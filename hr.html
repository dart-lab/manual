However, it's important to make sure you find a good match and to be clear about what is expected from an intern, or it can end up being a lot of work!</p> <p>Set up an initial meeting or skype to discuss &amp; follow up with an email giving clear definition of dates, times, funding availability (or lack of) and what is expected of them. Sample email text below.</p> <blockquote><p>We would be able to offer you a 1 day/week internship for 6 weeks at the DART lab, based at Kennedy Tower. However, we don't currently have any funding to pay you for this, so it would be an unpaid position. It is obviously completely up to you whether this is something you want to do: we do not want to exploit you and we understand if you're looking for a paid position. If an unpaid position is okay with you, we would do our best to make sure you got the most out of your time with us, and we'd be happy for you to start the position whenever you're ready.</p> <p>An internship would involve doing three main kinds of things. Firstly, some boring stuff: making materials for research days, including making signs for the building, photocopying participant packs, data entry, possibly emailing participants and scheduling them to come in etc. Secondly, some research skills-building stuff, including scoring psychological tests, drafting recruitment emails, doing a lit review. Thirdly, you could do some stuff to help you understand what a researcher does and the research process: you'd be able to shadow me at my meetings, come to our fortnightly lab meeting with the DART group, etc.</p> <p>We'd be able to give you a hot-desk on the 5th floor in a shared office, though you may need to provide your own laptop as we don't have a computer for that space at the moment.</p></blockquote> <p>From an admin point of view, tell Ken ASAP. He tells me people need a VRS entry (not sure what VRS is, sorry, but Ken sorts it out), a completed confidentiality form, and two references. They'll also need a health and safety building induction, with Ken, on their first day.</p> <p>If they need help extending their visa this is particularly tricky and not something I've managed with success, but for first port of call try <a href="mailto:visahelp@ed.ac.uk">visahelp@ed.ac.uk</a>.</p> <p>I suggest having a shared dropbox file which you use as a to-do list for the intern, adding things through the week that they can check on their intership day, rather than sending multiple emails. This has the added advantage of them having a list of everything they've done at the end of the project, which they can then use to update their CV, and that you can use to write a reference.</p> <p><strong>Make sure your Intern completes a Declaration of Confidentiality</strong> to show they have understood that they may be seeing confidential information during their time with us. This is important even if they aren't working with those data themselves -- they might see things over someone's shoulder etc. There's a template Declaration in the shared resources folder.</p> <h2 id="things-to-think-about-when-recruiting-a-volunteer-ra"><a href="#things-to-think-about-when-recruiting-a-volunteer-ra" class="header-anchor">#</a> Things to think about when recruiting a volunteer RA</h2> <p>[needs content]</p> <h2 id="recruiting-and-hiring-a-new-staff-member"><a href="#recruiting-and-hiring-a-new-staff-member" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recruiting and Hiring a new staff member</h2> <p><em>By Sue FW</em></p> <p>Here's a basic step by step outline of how to hire someone at UoE.

It's also a great opportunity to raise any issues you have or make suggestions for things that might help you to do your job better.</p> <p>In terms of preparation you will need to fill in section 1 and 3 of the form found here: <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/about/in-colleges/medicine-vet-medicine/p-and-d-r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/about/in-colleges/medicine-vet-medicine/p-and-d-r<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p> <p>If it's your first one you can use the &quot;Responsibilities&quot; part of your original job description for section 3. You should also have some idea of what you would like to discuss around sections 5 and 6. For example are there any courses you want to take? Is there a conference you would really like to present at? Do you want to get something published? Do you want to take time off? Are you happy with your working hours?</p> <p>It can be a really nice experience because if you're doing a good job you will get a ton of praise and if you're not then you'll get some gentle encouragement and advice on how to do better. It can also have the potential to be uncomfortable if you have issues to raise, don't like taking about yourself or about the future. If that's the case coming prepared and with an open mind might be helpful.</p> <h2 id="what-to-expect-from-your-first-year-phd-review"><a href="#what-to-expect-from-your-first-year-phd-review" class="header-anchor">#</a> What to expect from your first year PhD review</h2> <p><em>By Shereen Sharaan</em></p> <p><strong>What is it to begin with?</strong></p> <p>A 1^st^ year PhD review essentially evaluates whether a research plan is in place and whether the current supervision and resources are adequate to see this plan through. It also evaluates whether this plan is at PhD-level and whether the student has the potential to carry it out.</p> <p><strong>What is expected from you?</strong></p> <ul><li>You are expected to do a significant amount of literature review in your first year, and closer to the time of the PhD review (at least 1-2 weeks prior), you are expected to submit a written research proposal which zooms in on the research topic (specific questions) as well as how you approach the project (theory, methodology, potential outcomes, risks, resources, timeline, etc.).</li> <li>You may be expected to give an oral presentation to defend / discuss / expand on the written proposal as well your progress with the plan to date (this may include relevant trainings, conferences, writing, etc.). The number of words you are required to submit will vary from program to program (it is best to check with your school and supervision team).</li> <li>You are expected to upload all written documents on EUCLID (Annual Review Form) along with your completed sections of the form.</li> <li>You are expected to raise any concerns you have about your supervision team.</li> <li>You are expected to highlight any issues you are currently facing with your project and discuss how you might tackle them.</li> <li>Once your supervisors fill out their relevant sections on your annual review form, you are expected to review the form, and submit it for postgraduate director / school head sign off.</li></ul> <p><strong>Note on 'progress'</strong>: Because each PhD is structured differently, there is no standard measure for 'progress'. The important thing is to establish clear milestones with your supervision team (and their respective action points) for each year of the PhD program, and share progress updates throughout the year.</p> <p><strong>What is expected from your supervision team?</strong></p> <ul><li>Your supervision team is expected to nominate an independent person on the review committee (can also be referred to as a 'critical friend').</li> <li>Your supervision team is expected to share feedback and ask questions about your written proposal (whether your topic is clearly defined, whether you are on track to meet your research goals, etc.)</li> <li>Your supervision team is expected to fill out their detailed comments on the annual review form.</li> <li>Your supervision team is expected to share some immediate indication of the review outcome (PhD-track, M-Phil/MRes track, or withdraw).</li></ul> <p>The <a href="https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CPW&amp;title=CCBS+Postgraduate+wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">postgraduate Wiki<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> is a great place to look for more info if you are a student within CCBS.</p> <h1 id="managing-people"><a href="#managing-people" class="header-anchor">#</a> Managing People</h1> <h2 id="writing-a-reference"><a href="#writing-a-reference" class="header-anchor">#</a> Writing a reference</h2> <p><em>By Sue FW</em></p> <p>[needs content]</p> <p>When you've finished, run your reference through this <a href="https://www.tomforth.co.uk/genderbias/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gendered language checker<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>.</p> <h2 id="what-is-the-talent-register-and-why-should-you-care"><a href="#what-is-the-talent-register-and-why-should-you-care" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is the talent register and why should you care?</h2> <p><em>By Sue FW</em></p> <p>The Talent Register provides anonymised details of staff available for redeployment to those who are recruiting for staff in the University.</p> <p>Staff are eligible for redeployment as a result of being at risk of redundancy, for health or medical reasons or when a position has been red-circled. If you are in the final five months of a UoE contract you can add your details to the register. Anyone recruiting to a new post is required to check the Talent Register first to see if there's an eligible person already listed.
