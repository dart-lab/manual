collection or entry to do. However, it's important to make sure you find
a good match and to be clear about what is expected from an intern, or
it can end up being a lot of work!</p> <p>Set up an initial meeting or skype to discuss &amp; follow up with an email
giving clear definition of dates, times, funding availability (or lack
of) and what is expected of them. Sample email text below.</p> <blockquote><p>We would be able to offer you a 1 day/week internship for 6 weeks at
the DART lab, based at Kennedy Tower. However, we don't currently have
any funding to pay you for this, so it would be an unpaid position. It
is obviously completely up to you whether this is something you want
to do: we do not want to exploit you and we understand if you're
looking for a paid position. If an unpaid position is okay with you,
we would do our best to make sure you got the most out of your time
with us, and we'd be happy for you to start the position whenever
you're ready.</p> <p>An internship would involve doing three main kinds of things. Firstly,
some boring stuff: making materials for research days, including
making signs for the building, photocopying participant packs, data
entry, possibly emailing participants and scheduling them to come in
etc. Secondly, some research skills-building stuff, including scoring
psychological tests, drafting recruitment emails, doing a lit review.
Thirdly, you could do some stuff to help you understand what a
researcher does and the research process: you'd be able to shadow me
at my meetings, come to our fortnightly lab meeting with the DART
group, etc.</p> <p>We'd be able to give you a hot-desk on the 5th floor in a shared
office, though you may need to provide your own laptop as we don't
have a computer for that space at the moment.</p></blockquote> <p>From an admin point of view, tell Ken ASAP. He tells me people need a
VRS entry (not sure what VRS is, sorry, but Ken sorts it out), a
completed confidentiality form, and two references. They'll also need a
health and safety building induction, with Ken, on their first day.</p> <p>If they need help extending their visa this is particularly tricky and
not something I've managed with success, but for first port of call try
<a href="mailto:visahelp@ed.ac.uk">visahelp@ed.ac.uk</a></p> <p>I suggest having a shared dropbox file which you use as a to-do list for
the intern, adding things through the week that they can check on their
intership day, rather than sending multiple emails. This has the added
advantage of them having a list of everything they've done at the end of
the project, which they can then use to update their CV, and that you
can use to write a reference.</p> <p><strong>Make sure your Intern completes a Declaration of Confidentiality</strong> to
show they have understood that they may be seeing confidential
information during their time with us. This is important even if they
aren't working with those data themselves -- they might see things over
someone's shoulder etc. There's a template Declaration in the shared
resources folder.</p> <h2 id="volunteer-ras-things-to-think-about-when-recruiting-a-vra"><a href="#volunteer-ras-things-to-think-about-when-recruiting-a-vra" class="header-anchor">#</a> Volunteer RAs - things to think about when recruiting a VRA</h2> <p>[needs content]</p> <h2 id="recruiting-and-hiring-a-new-staff-member"><a href="#recruiting-and-hiring-a-new-staff-member" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recruiting and Hiring a new staff member</h2> <p><em>By Sue FW</em></p> <p>Here's a basic step by step outline of how to hire someone at UoE.

and agree it with anyone else involved in hiring. This is an
important part of the process -- if your JD is too narrow you might
not get a range of applicants to choose from. If it is too broad you

Make sure the room is accessible.</p></li> <li><p>After the interviews, HR will ask to collect in your notes and
ratings, and they will inform the unsuccessful candidates. It's nice
to offer feedback if anyone gets in touch.</p></li> <li><p>For the successful person, you can offer the job directly by phone.
Make sure you clarify that this is 'subject to references' if they
haven't already been received. Once all references are in, you need
to get their contract issued so keep an eye on this with HR.</p></li> <li><p>The final stage is to think about induction -- what are they going
to do in their first days / weeks in post? What resources and
training do they need? Who do they need to meet?</p></li></ol> <p>* <em>as a rule of thumb, undergrad degree = UE05, masters degree = UE06,
PhD = UE07, postdoc with a few years' experience / lecturer = UE08,
senior lecturer / reader = UE09, professor = UE10. Remember that
experience in a relevant role is often better than a degree though!</em></p> <p>In summary, here is a <strong>timeline for recruitment</strong>, assuming you don't
find anyone on the talent register -- if you do it'll take longer:</p> <ol><li><p>Draft and agree the job description with your team: +1 weeks</p></li> <li><p>Job grading completed: +5 weeks</p></li> <li><p>Talent register checked: +1 week</p></li> <li><p>Job advert posted on UoE Vacancies site: +2 weeks</p></li> <li><p>Application closes: + 2 weeks minimum, + 4 weeks normally. <em>You
can't recruit outside the EU unless you advertise for 4 weeks or
more.</em></p></li> <li><p>Long-listing candidates: + 1 weeks</p></li> <li><p>Discuss shortlist for interview with your panel: +1 week</p></li> <li><p>Send interview invitations: +1 week</p></li> <li><p>Interviews: +2 weeks</p></li></ol> <p>In other words, recruiting someone will normally take about four months.
If you expedite every stage you might get this down to 3 months, but
rarely less than that.</p> <h2 id="writing-a-reference"><a href="#writing-a-reference" class="header-anchor">#</a> Writing a reference</h2> <p><em>By Sue FW</em></p> <p>[needs content]</p> <p>When you've finished, run your reference through this <a href="https://www.tomforth.co.uk/genderbias/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gendered language

redeployment to those who are recruiting for staff in the University.</p> <p>Staff are eligible for redeployment as a result of being at risk of
redundancy, for health or medical reasons or when a position has been
red-circled. If you are in the final five months of a UoE contract you
can add your details to the register. Anyone recruiting to a new post is
required to check the Talent Register first to see if there's an
eligible person already listed. This is a great way to sustain
employment at the University.</p> <p>You can find out more here:

you...don't be alarmed! PandDR is short for Performance and Development
Review. All university staff have to check in once a year to make sure
they are meeting their objectives, that they are supported in doing so
by their supervisor and to set future goals. It's a lot less scary than
it sounds and a pretty casual affair. It's less about evaluating your
performance and more about identifying areas you can improve on and
opportunities for training/development and career progression. It's also
a great opportunity to raise any issues you have or make suggestions for
things that might help you to do your job better.</p> <p>In terms of preparation you will need to fill in section 1 and 3 of the
form found here:</p> <p><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/about/in-colleges/medicine-vet-medicine/p-and-d-r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/about/in-colleges/medicine-vet-medicine/p-and-d-r<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p> <p>If it's your first one you can use the &quot;Responsibilities&quot; part of your
original job description for section 3. You should also have some idea
of what you would like to discuss around sections 5 and 6. For example
are there any courses you want to take? Is there a conference you would
really like to present at? Do you want to get something published? Do
you want to take time off? Are you happy with your working hours?</p> <p>It can be a really nice experience because if you're doing a good job
you will get a ton of praise and if you're not then you'll get some
gentle encouragement and advice on how to do better. It can also have
the potential to be uncomfortable if you have issues to raise, don't
like taking about yourself or about the future. If that's the case
coming prepared and with an open mind might be helpful.</p> <h2 id="what-to-expect-from-your-first-year-phd-review"><a href="#what-to-expect-from-your-first-year-phd-review" class="header-anchor">#</a> What to expect from your first year PhD review</h2> <p><em>By Shereen Sharaan</em></p> <p><strong>What is it to begin with?</strong></p> <p>A 1^st^ year PhD review essentially evaluates whether a research plan is
in place and whether the current supervision and resources are adequate
to see this plan through. It also evaluates whether this plan is at
PhD-level and whether the student has the potential to carry it out.</p> <p><strong>What is expected from you?</strong></p> <ul><li><p>You are expected to do a significant amount of literature review in
your first year, and closer to the time of the PhD review (at least
1-2 weeks prior), you are expected to submit a written research
proposal which zooms in on the research topic (specific questions)
as well as how you approach the project (theory, methodology,
potential outcomes, risks, resources, timeline, etc.).</p></li> <li><p>You may be expected to give an oral presentation to defend / discuss
/ expand on the written proposal as well your progress with the plan
to date (this may include relevant trainings, conferences, writing,
etc.). The number of words you are required to submit will vary from
program to program (it is best to check with your school and
supervision team).</p></li> <li><p>You are expected to upload all written documents on EUCLID (Annual
Review Form) along with your completed sections of the form.</p></li> <li><p>You are expected to raise any concerns you have about your
supervision team.</p></li> <li><p>You are expected to highlight any issues you are currently facing
with your project and discuss how you might tackle them.</p></li> <li><p>Once your supervisors fill out their relevant sections on your
annual review form, you are expected to review the form, and submit
it for postgraduate director / school head sign off.</p></li></ul> <p>[*Note on 'progress']{.underline}: Because each PhD is structured
differently, there is no standard measure for 'progress'. The important
thing is to establish clear milestones with your supervision team (and
their respective action points) for each year of the PhD program, and
share progress updates throughout the year.</p> <p><strong>What is expected from your supervision team?</strong></p> <ul><li><p>Your supervision team is expected to nominate an independent person
on the review committee (can also be referred to as a 'critical
friend').</p></li> <li><p>Your supervision team is expected to share feedback and ask
questions about your written proposal (whether your topic is clearly
defined, whether you are on track to meet your research goals, etc.)</p></li> <li><p>Your supervision team is expected to fill out their detailed
comments on the annual review form.</p></li> <li><p>Your supervision team is expected to share some immediate indication
of the review outcome (PhD-track, M-Phil/MRes track, or withdraw).</p></li></ul> <p>The <a href="https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CPW&amp;title=CCBS+Postgraduate+wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">postgraduate
