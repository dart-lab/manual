Clinical Sciences Psychiatry</li> <li>Add the amount, and the date the expenses was incurred -- i.e. when
you paid for it, not when it happened.</li> <li>For specific expenses like Travel there will also be other fields to
complete. It is worth adding as much detail as you can.</li> <li>Save the item. Then select the paperclip icon on the right-hand side
to upload relevant documents. There should be a scanned receipt /
e-receipt (e.g. downloaded email) for every item.</li> <li>You can then go back to step 5 above, and add additional items to
your claim.</li> <li>Once you have all your items added, you can submit the claim</li> <li>Then print the claim and attach [Lizzy note: don't staple the
receipts to the form] any paper receipts. You need to attach paper
receipts for anything where the original receipt was not digital --
e.g. meals.</li> <li>Get the claim signed by a more senior budget holder -- normally Sue
FW -- and then submit the paperwork to Ken.</li> <li>When your claim is paid you will receive an email with a &quot;Remittance
Advice&quot; notifying you of the amount which has been paid into your
account. If you submitted multiple claims at once, this will be for
the total of all approved claims.</li> <li>It is possible that your claim will be queried by the Approval Group
in which case you will receive an email notification. You can log in
to eExpenses again and edit your claim / provide additional
information. Even if you have a conversation about the claim, make
sure you record all the details here, otherwise the claim may be
knocked back by central finance.</li></ol> <p>NB: if your expense is in a foreign currency, you should claim the
actual cost in £. The easiest way to do this is to attached a redacted
(removing any private information) copy of your bank statement / credit
card statement with the actual payment listed. You can claim for the
cost of the item and any bank fees associated with the transaction --
just add these up and put them through as a single claim item.</p> <p>* <em>noting of course that we should aim to book travel and accommodation through Diversity Travel (see section lower down this page)!</em></p> <h2 id="definitions-of-uoe-expenses-terminology-and-systems"><a href="#definitions-of-uoe-expenses-terminology-and-systems" class="header-anchor">#</a> Definitions of UoE expenses terminology and systems</h2> <p><em>By Lizzy Kirkham &amp; Sue FW</em></p> <h3 id="finance-codes"><a href="#finance-codes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Finance Codes</h3> <p><strong>Account code:</strong> the type of expenditure or income.

on Travel, or Salaries or Consumables. If you spend money on Travel from
a R-<strong>job code</strong> it will be a different 4-digit code to if you spend
money on Travel from a D-<strong>job code</strong>.</p> <p>Note that you can only use an account code if it has a <strong>job code</strong>
attached to it. In other words, you need to be assigning your Travel
(Account Code) expenses to a specific pot of money (Job Code).</p> <p><strong>Cost centre:</strong> the part of the University that holds the specific
<strong>Job Code</strong> (see below) you are using. The Psychiatry Cost Centre is
214PSY. Cost Centres are all 6-digits long and have a combination of
letters and numbers. Most grants awarded to PIs in Psychiatry will be in
this Cost Centre. In the real world, the Cost Centre is something like
your Sort Code on your personal bank account.</p> <p><strong>Job code:</strong> the code for the budget (i.e. &quot;pot of money&quot;) you are
using. This is like your bank account number. Job codes start with a
letter, and the letter is meaningful. D is for donation accounts --
which apply if you have funding from a private donor. R is for Research
accounts -- which apply if you have a research grant. G is for general
accounts like the departmental fund for Psychiatry.</p> <h3 id="grant-costing-terminology"><a href="#grant-costing-terminology" class="header-anchor">#</a> Grant costing terminology</h3> <p><strong>Costings</strong> are estimates of how much it will cost to do the project.</p> <p><strong>Direct costs</strong> are things that won't be paid for you if don't win the
grant. An example would be the salary of someone who would be recruited
to do the work on the grant, or consumables and equipment that will be
bought with the grant money if you win it. Sometimes these can be split
into <strong>directly incurred</strong> and <strong>directly allocated.</strong> The latter are
costs that are being assigned to the project. Salaries of staff already
employed by the University are a good example of this -- the salary is
being paid by the University regardless of whether you win the grant,
but if you get the funding a proportion of this person's time (and an
associated proportion of their salary) is being <em>allocated</em> to the
grant. E.g. the ESRC pay for 5% of my salary and I give them 5% of my
working week.</p> <p><strong>Indirect costs</strong> are costs that the University will be paying for
whether or not you get the grant. Sometimes, depending on the funder,
the example above (existing staff salaries) count as indirect costs.
Other kinds of indirect costs include things like the University's
electricity and gas bill, the costs of the Library, HR department and
central admin.</p> <p><strong>Full economic costing</strong> is the estimated total cost of carrying out
the research. This includes all the things you ask the funder to pay for
(e.g. RA salary, questionnaires, participant expenses) plus all the
indirect costs. Different funders will pay different proportions of
indirect costs.</p> <h3 id="other-terminology"><a href="#other-terminology" class="header-anchor">#</a> Other Terminology</h3> <p><strong>Approved Supplier:</strong> An approved supplier is someone or something (an
organisation) that the University have decided is a legitimate provider
of good and services. You can ask a finance officer for lists of
approved suppliers (e.g. all the companies that are approved to provide
transcription services) or ask them to check whether a specific person /
company is already an approved supplier. If the company you want to use
is not an approved supplier, you can request that the company you want
to use gets approved. There's information below on how to do this.</p> <p>For an individual to become an approved supplier they need to be
self-employed and able to demonstrate that. There's more about this
below in the section on How to pay external consultants / providers</p> <p><strong>Consumables:</strong> most of the things you purchase for a research grant
will be classed as Consumables. These are any items you buy and expect
to &quot;use up&quot; over the course of the project. Examples might be
questionnaire response forms, or gift vouchers for participants. Even
things you won't literally use up might come under this category -- e.g.
toys, or a manual for a specific psychological assessment. Imagine you
lost the item -- would you claim it on insurance, or just buy a new one?
If the latter, it's consumable.</p> <p>Anything more expensive / permanent is classed as <strong>Equipment.</strong> This
includes most IT, and things like eye-trackers.</p> <p><strong>Purchase Order:</strong> A purchase order is essential a request for some
sort of paid service / supply. Finance officers can raise a purchase
order for specific items. For example, you might request a purchase
order for a specific number of hours of an external academic's time.
Many external providers -- like other Universities, or the NHS -- need a
Purchase Order before they can then send an invoice (i.e. a bill) for
the service provided.</p> <p>Purchase Orders provide a number of advantages. They get the transaction
added to the system, so now there is a reference associated with that
item. They also give your finance officer a chance to raise any concerns
they might have early in the process. You have a chance to check that
the service being provided is from an approved supplier and that all
their paperwork is in order.</p> <p><strong>Subsistence:</strong> this is the term used to describe the costs of being
away from home. Subsistence expenses basically normally means meals,
when you're away at a conference. You might also class local travel
(e.g. bus or metro journeys) under this umbrella. Subsistence can also
describe some of the costs of hosting visitors -- like catering for a
meeting or taking a guest out for dinner.</p> <h3 id="systems"><a href="#systems" class="header-anchor">#</a> Systems</h3> <p><strong>eExpenses</strong> is an online system for claiming back expenses that you
have personally incurred in the course of your work. Examples might be
meals while away at a conference, or buying some toys for a research
study. There's information above on how to use eExpenses.</p> <p><strong>Webfirst</strong> is an online system for checking balances, transactions,
expenditure and income for specific Job Codes. You need to request

DART Resources folder under Finance. Do check you have the latest copy
of the form before you send it to an external provider for completion.</p> <p><strong>Option 1</strong>: If the consultant is self-employed they can be added as an
approved supplier, and then invoice the University for their services.
The steps are:</p> <ol><li>The consultant must complete a Supplier Self-Declaration Form, and
provide HMRC confirmation that they are registered for
self-assessment, plus details of their bank account and registered
VAT number (if they have one)</li> <li>You must complete an Employment Status questionnaire, and an
Engagement of Services Agreement. These explain what you asking the
external provider to do and lay out the University's legal
obligations to them as a new &quot;employee&quot;. This is essentially in lieu
of a proper contract of employment. It is a useful process to go
through.</li> <li>The documents need to be sent to payroll for approval (by your local
finance officer) -- they in turn send them to HMRC for confirmation
so it takes a while</li> <li>After confirmation is received from HMRC and Payroll, the provider
can be added to the Approved Suppliers list.</li> <li>They can then invoice the University and receive payment.</li></ol> <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> If the consultant is not self-employed they can be paid
<strong>once in a tax year</strong> using an &quot;Ad-Hoc Payment Form-100&quot;. They need to
complete the form, and present their passport to Human Resources at the
University -- the passport has to be presented in person, a copy will
not be accepted.</p> <p>It is worth asking any external consultants to review the form in
advance to check they are happy to share this kind of information. If
they have questions, these statements from HR might be helpful:</p> <blockquote><p><strong>Form 100 --- equality information:</strong> The University is obliged to
collect data to on the equality [protected] characteristics of
employees to comply with statutory legislative reporting requirements
under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) (Scotland)
Regulations 2012. Additionally, the University is required by the
Further and Higher Education Act 1992 to submit statistical returns to
the Higher Education Statistics Agency [HESA]. Currently we are
required to return annual staff data on sex, race/ethnicity,
disability and age, under category labels set down by HESA. You are
not obliged to provide this information to us but it helps the
University to consider whether the diversity of our employees fully
reflects society, and to identify and remove barriers to employment.</p> <p><strong>Passport check:</strong> The University is required, by the Home Office UK
Visas and Immigration rules (Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act
2006) to verify the 'right to work' of any person who undertakes any
work at the University of Edinburgh, including those who are British
or from the European Economic Area (EEA).  This is irrespective of the
length or nature of your employment, and means that the University
must carry out document checks on people before employing them to make
sure they are allowed to work in the UK. Failure of the University to
comply with these requirements would result in the University being
fined or, more importantly, losing the right to employ individuals who
are not nationals of the EEA.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Option 3:</strong> If the consultant is a member of a steering committee /
reference group for a study, the easiest way to pay them as is a
subsistence payment for each meeting they attend.</p> <h2 id="how-to-pay-uoe-employees-or-students-for-work-or-overtime"><a href="#how-to-pay-uoe-employees-or-students-for-work-or-overtime" class="header-anchor">#</a> How to pay UoE employees or students for work or overtime</h2> <p>[needs content]</p> <h2 id="booking-travel-through-the-university"><a href="#booking-travel-through-the-university" class="header-anchor">#</a> Booking travel through the University</h2> <h3 id="diversity-travel"><a href="#diversity-travel" class="header-anchor">#</a> Diversity Travel</h3> <p>The UoE has a new (in 2022) travel contract with <a href="https://www.diversitytravel.com/uk/what-we-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diversity Travel<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>.

some grant providers have issues with projects using Airbnb so contact
your grant manager and check that they (the funder) are happy to cover
these costs.</p> <p><strong>Also please</strong> note that:</p> <ul><li>Airbnb is not regulated and may fail to meet basic safety
standards such as smoke detection, electrical testing, extinguishers and
fire escape.</li> <li>Airbnb is highly unlikely to share traveller information with
the University in the event of an emergency.</li> <li>Airbnb hosts sometimes cancel at the last minute for various
reasons and UoE insurance will not cover any direct or indirect costs
associated with that. Airbnb hosts may have no insurance and their
normal domestic insurance may not cover them for letting rooms.</li> <li>Airbnb hosts may trade illegally if the host city, for
instance, does not permit short-term room rentals. The accommodation may
be an unused back bedroom in a stranger's house. The accommodation will
often be less secure than a hotel, with no CCTV, key control, robust
door locks, swipe access or room safe. Travellers should wherever
possible favour accommodation where it has smoke detection and good
locks / security.</li> <li>Airbnb bookings may be illegal if the country / region / city
/ building does not permit short-term room rentals, or if the host has
not complied with local regulations but nonetheless advertises the
property on the platform regardless.</li></ul> <p>In order to avoid some of these problems, travellers can use the Airbnb
platform ONLY where:</p> <ul><li>You can identify that the country / city / region / building
permits short-term lets and the property complies with local
regulations, so the booking is legal.</li> <li>There is a reasonably full history of positive reviews</li> <li>The accommodation is a self-contained apartment (so you aren't
staying in a stranger's back bedroom or similar).</li> <li>You can identify the neighbourhood as safe.</li> <li>You don't rely only on the Airbnb bookings calendar, but also
email the host directly, as some hosts are not assiduous about updating
calendars.</li> <li>You leave full contact details in your travel plan including
location of the apartment and owner contact details.</li></ul> <p>Please remember to have a valid insurance policy, which you can arrange
