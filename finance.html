If you spend money on Travel from a R-<strong>job code</strong> it will be a different 4-digit code to if you spend money on Travel from a D-<strong>job code</strong>.</p> <p>Note that you can only use an account code if it has a <strong>job code</strong> attached to it. In other  words, you need to be assigning your Travel (Account Code) expenses to a specific pot of  money (Job Code).</p> <p><strong>Cost centre:</strong> the part of the University that holds the specific <strong>Job Code</strong> (see below) you are using. The Psychiatry Cost Centre is 214PSY. Cost Centres are all 6-digits long and have a combination of letters and numbers. Most grants awarded to PIs in Psychiatry will be in this Cost Centre. In the real world, the Cost Centre is something like your Sort Code on your personal bank account.</p> <p><strong>Job code:</strong> the code for the budget (i.e. &quot;pot of money&quot;) you are using. This is like your bank account number. Job codes start with a letter, and the letter is meaningful. D is for donation accounts -- which apply if you have funding from a private donor. R is for Research accounts -- which apply if you have a research grant. G is for general accounts like the departmental fund for Psychiatry.</p> <h3 id="grant-costing-terminology"><a href="#grant-costing-terminology" class="header-anchor">#</a> Grant costing terminology</h3> <p><strong>Costings</strong> are estimates of how much it will cost to do the project.</p> <p><strong>Direct costs</strong> are things that won't be paid for you if don't win the grant. An example would be the salary of someone who would be recruited to do the work on the grant, or consumables and equipment that will be bought with the grant money if you win it. Sometimes these can be split into <strong>directly incurred</strong> and <strong>directly allocated.</strong> The latter are costs that are being assigned to the project. Salaries of staff already employed by the University are a good example of this -- the salary is being paid by the University regardless of whether you win the grant, but if you get the funding a proportion of this person's time (and an associated proportion of their salary) is being <em>allocated</em> to the grant. E.g. the ESRC pay for 5% of my salary and I give them 5% of my working week.</p> <p><strong>Indirect costs</strong> are costs that the University will be paying for whether or not you get the grant. Sometimes, depending on the funder, the example above (existing staff salaries) count as indirect costs. Other kinds of indirect costs include things like the University's electricity and gas bill, the costs of the Library, HR department and central admin.</p> <p><strong>Full economic costing</strong> is the estimated total cost of carrying out the research. This includes all the things you ask the funder to pay for (e.g. RA salary, questionnaires, participant expenses) plus all the indirect costs. Different funders will pay different proportions of indirect costs.</p> <h3 id="other-terminology"><a href="#other-terminology" class="header-anchor">#</a> Other Terminology</h3> <p><strong>Approved Supplier:</strong> An approved supplier is someone or something (an organisation) that the University have decided is a legitimate provider of good and services. You can ask a finance officer for lists of approved suppliers (e.g. all the companies that are approved to provide transcription services) or ask them to check whether a specific person / company is already an approved supplier. If the company you want to use is not an approved supplier, you can request that the company you want to use gets approved. There's information below on how to do this.</p> <p>For an individual to become an approved supplier they need to be self-employed and able to demonstrate that. There's more about this below in the section on How to pay external consultants / providers</p> <p><strong>Consumables:</strong> most of the things you purchase for a research grant will be classed as Consumables. These are any items you buy and expect to &quot;use up&quot; over the course of the project. Examples might be questionnaire response forms, or gift vouchers for participants. Even things you won't literally use up might come under this category -- e.g. toys, or a manual for a specific psychological assessment. Imagine you lost the item -- would you claim it on insurance, or just buy a new one? If the latter, it's consumable.</p> <p>Anything more expensive / permanent is classed as <strong>Equipment.</strong> This includes most IT, and things like eye-trackers.</p> <p><strong>Purchase Order:</strong> A purchase order is essential a request for some sort of paid service / supply. Finance officers can raise a purchase order for specific items. For example, you might request a purchase order for a specific number of hours of an external academic's time. Many external providers -- like other Universities, or the NHS -- need a Purchase Order before they can then send an invoice (i.e. a bill) for the service provided.</p> <p>Purchase Orders provide a number of advantages. They get the transaction added to the system, so now there is a reference associated with that item. They also give your finance officer a chance to raise any concerns they might have early in the process. You have a chance to check that the service being provided is from an approved supplier and that all their paperwork is in order.</p> <p><strong>Subsistence:</strong> this is the term used to describe the costs of being away from home. Subsistence expenses basically normally means meals, when you're away at a conference. You might also class local travel (e.g. bus or metro journeys) under this umbrella. Subsistence can also describe some of the costs of hosting visitors -- like catering for a meeting or taking a guest out for dinner.</p> <h3 id="systems"><a href="#systems" class="header-anchor">#</a> Systems</h3> <p><strong>eExpenses</strong> has been replaced by People &amp; Money.</p> <p><strong>People &amp; Money</strong> does everything from expenses to HR to holiday time booking.

If they have questions, these statements from HR might be helpful:</p> <blockquote><p><strong>Form 100 --- equality information:</strong> The University is obliged to collect data to on the equality [protected] characteristics of employees to comply with statutory legislative reporting requirements under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) (Scotland) Regulations 2012. Additionally, the University is required by the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 to submit statistical returns to the Higher Education Statistics Agency [HESA]. Currently we are required to return annual staff data on sex, race/ethnicity, disability and age, under category labels set down by HESA. You are not obliged to provide this information to us but it helps the University to consider whether the diversity of our employees fully reflects society, and to identify and remove barriers to employment.</p> <p><strong>Passport check:</strong> The University is required, by the Home Office UK Visas and Immigration rules (Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006) to verify the 'right to work' of any person who undertakes any work at the University of Edinburgh, including those who are British or from the European Economic Area (EEA).  This is irrespective of the length or nature of your employment, and means that the University must carry out document checks on people before employing them to make sure they are allowed to work in the UK. Failure of the University to comply with these requirements would result in the University being fined or, more importantly, losing the right to employ individuals who are not nationals of the EEA.</p></blockquote> <h3 id="option-3-subsistence-payment"><a href="#option-3-subsistence-payment" class="header-anchor">#</a> Option 3: Subsistence Payment</h3> <p>If the consultant is a member of a steering committee / reference group for a study, the easiest way to pay them as is a subsistence payment for each meeting they attend.</p> <h2 id="paying-uoe-employees-or-students-for-work-or-overtime"><a href="#paying-uoe-employees-or-students-for-work-or-overtime" class="header-anchor">#</a> Paying UoE employees or students for work or overtime</h2> <p>[needs content]</p> <h1 id="buying-things"><a href="#buying-things" class="header-anchor">#</a> Buying Things</h1> <h2 id="ordering-consumables-and-equipment-through-the-university"><a href="#ordering-consumables-and-equipment-through-the-university" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ordering consumables and equipment through the University</h2> <p><em>by Sue FW</em></p> <p><strong>In most cases:</strong> Please email Sue D with order requests and copy in Sue FW.  Sue D will action these orders on the assumption that cc-ing SFW indicates approval.
