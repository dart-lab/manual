## A list of nice places to go nearby

_By Lorna Ginnell_

We are super lucky to be situated in an area with a great selection of
cafés and eateries! Here are some gems:

* For breakfast or coffee meetings: _Project Coffee_ (warning, no
  Wi-Fi!)
* For dreamy breakfasts (and treats) when you're not planning on doing
  any work: _Honeycomb and Co_
* For those days in the office when you need a pick me up and instant
  coffee just won't do: _The Counter (Kiosk next to M&S)_
* For when you want to escape from the office but don't want to go too
  far: _The Round Square, Blackwood Coffee, Café Nero_
* Hot Chocolate: _The Chocolate Tree_
* The best sandwiches: _Karine's Deli_
* Grab and go lunches: _M&S, Waitrose_ (they also have a Sushi Bar)
* A quiet place to do some solo work: _Redbox (in Marchmont)._ OK so
  this is like half an hour away but it's really spacious, not too
  busy and has lots of plugs and free Wi-Fi! And good coffee and sweet
  treats. So a nice place to settle in and write for the day.
* After work drinks: _The Hermitage, Montpelier, Black Ivy_
* Dinner: _Montpelier, Mia's Italian, Nonas_
* Walks: _The Braid & Blackford Hill, Bruntsfield Links_
