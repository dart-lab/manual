# Useful contractors

## Graphic Design

[http://scottmcallisterdesign.co.uk](http://scottmcallisterdesign.co.uk) -- recommended though not used yet,
an autistic graphic designer in Scotland.

David Roberts (designroute.hello@gmail.com) has done some graphic design work for Catherine before (happy to share examples). He's a registered supplier at the University so easy to pay, and happy to do small bits of graphic design work - many of the other University registered suppliers only take on bigger jobs.
