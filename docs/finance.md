General information about financial transactions within CCBS
------------------------------------------------------------

*by Sue FW*

1. **Submit the request on the appropriate form**

UoE forms can be downloaded from [www.ed.ac.uk/finance/for-staff/forms](http://www.ed.ac.uk/finance/for-staff/forms)

**Tip**: Search for "finance forms" on the University website to
download the correct form each time rather than save local copies, which
might go out of date.

The purchasing request form is CCBS-specific and can be downloaded from
the CCBS website Staff Only pages at [www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/staff-only/ccbs-information-everyone](http://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/staff-only/ccbs-information-everyone)

2.  **Fill in [all]{.underline} the details [before]{.underline}
    submitting to your finance officer or local contact**

Make sure that the UoE finance code is fully completed, and all relevant
contact name and addresses have been supplied. Your local contact will
normally be **Sue Davidson**.

UoE finance codes are made up of three parts, and all three are needed
for a transaction.

e.g.
| 217CHA                                                                                           | 3138                                                                                                                                        | R12345                                           |
| -                                                                                                | -                                                                                                                                           | -                                                |
| **Cost Centre** - this is like the sort code; it's specific to the individual or research group. | **Account code** - this identifies the category of the purchase/sale, for instance 3138 refers to Research Consumables, 3432 is for Postage | **Job code\*** - this is like the account number |


\*The initial letter of the job code refers to the type of account: R =
research grant; D = donation; G = general

- 'R' job codes have a restricted set of account codes that can be
  used, according to what you applied for in your grant. [Please
  don't pair an R job code with an account code that doesn't apply
  to that grant]{.underline}.

  Please look up on webfirst and keep a note of which account codes can
  be paired with which R numbers. If you don't have access to you job
  code on webfirst, please contact the Centre Manager.

- 'D' job codes can also be restricted, if a restriction has been
  specified in the donation agreement.

- 'G' job codes can be used with any account code.

3. **Obtain authorisation from the PI/budget holder
    [before]{.underline} submitting**

This will normally be Sue FW

4. **Submit your request to your [single contact person]{.underline}**

Please don't copy in other people who might be able to help. This can
cause confusion over responsibilities and often slows things up.

5.  **Please be patient -- wait at least 3 days before following up**

Specific transaction types within CCBS
--------------------------------------

**Purchase orders** (PO): Please fill a purchasing request form
(download from CCBS website) and send one email with all the details
available for your product including full grant coding. If you don't
know the details, please ask your PI, and obtain their full
authorisation.

**Invoices:** Please send only one email with a scan of the invoice and
grant codes once you get authorisation from PI. Please check if invoices
have a contact email and bank details, and provide these details if they
are not stated on the invoice.

**Expenses for non-staff:** Complete the 'Payment for non-staff /
non-students expenses' form and submit it once you have PI approval and
signature and all all the grant coding has been added. Please complete
the form with full address and bank details. Please also send an email
from the non-staff member confirming their bank details as Accounts
Payable will need to see this email.

**Suppliers that are not in our system:** The supplier will need to
completes the 'Supplier Self-Declaration form' and provide a headed
company letter with full bank details including bank address.

**International payments:** Please send the invoice with all above
details including full grant coding.

**Internal Transfers**: Please send the School and Sub-Unit and the name
of the authoriser plus grant codes and explain clearly if this is to pay
for something or to receive a payment

**Sales invoices**: Please request a PO from the customer and provide
full grant details

How to use WebFirst
-------------------

*By Sue FW*

**Webfirst** is an online system for checking balances, transactions,
expenditure and income for specific Job Codes. You need to request
access to specific Job Codes by emailing Val Renton. [You can access
WebFirst here](https://www.webfirst.fin.ed.ac.uk/).

WebFirst prompts you to choose from a range of different types of
reports on the left-hand side of the page -- e.g. all transactions in a
specific period, or a round-up of total spending to date. The report
names are quite hard to understand and so they are very hard to decide
between! [There are descriptions
here.](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/Finance/WebFirst+-+Available+Reports)
If you find a report format that is useful, it's worth saving it in your
Favourites / making a note to access it again!

How to make an expense claim through e-expenses
-----------------------------------------------

*By Sue FW*

**Wherever possible, you should try to make purchases through University
suppliers instead of paying for things yourself and claiming them
back**. You can book travel & accommodation through Key Travel (see
section below), order office suppliers and IT equipment through Ken
O'Neill / Sue Davidson / your local finance administrator, and pay
approved suppliers directly (e.g. transcription services) by asking them
to invoice the University.

You can [access eExpenses here](https://www.expenses.finance.ed.ac.uk/).

To use eExpenses, you need to register first -- ask Ken O'Neill or your
local finance administrator for a registration form.

When using eExpenses, the approximate step-by-step process is as
follows:

1. Log in using your EASE details

2. Select Create A Claim on the left hand side

3. Give your claim item a sensible title, such as "BPS conference
   expenses". You can claim a bunch of things at the same time and it
   makes sense to group them by event (e.g. travel, accommodation and
   meals for a conference\*). Don't make a claim for every single
   receipt.

4. If you think your claim is at all unusual or confusing, use the
   "additional details" box to add information

5. Then for each item in the claim select the Category (e.g. Research
   Grant) and Expense Type (e.g. Consumables)

6. Enter a description for the item, e.g. SRS manual

7. Select the Cost Centre that is the 'parent' for the Job Code you are
   claiming from

8. Select the Job Code

9. Select an Approval Group -- this is the group of finance officers
   who will be asked to approve your claim. The Approval Group should
   match the Cost Centre. E.g. Cost Centre = 214PSY, approval group =
   Clinical Sciences Psychiatry

10. Add the amount, and the date the expenses was incurred -- i.e. when
    you paid for it, not when it happened.

11. For specific expenses like Travel there will also be other fields to
    complete. It is worth adding as much detail as you can.

12. Save the item. Then select the paperclip icon on the right-hand side
    to upload relevant documents. There should be a scanned receipt /
    e-receipt (e.g. downloaded email) for every item.

13. You can then go back to step 5 above, and add additional items to
    your claim.

14. Once you have all your items added, you can submit the claim

15. Then print the claim and attach \[Lizzy note: don't staple the
    receipts to the form\] any paper receipts. You need to attach paper
    receipts for anything where the original receipt was not digital --
    e.g. meals.

16. Get the claim signed by a more senior budget holder -- normally Sue
    FW -- and then submit the paperwork to Ken.

17. When your claim is paid you will receive an email with a "Remittance
    Advice" notifying you of the amount which has been paid into your
    account. If you submitted multiple claims at once, this will be for
    the total of all approved claims.

18. It is possible that your claim will be queried by the Approval Group
    in which case you will receive an email notification. You can log in
    to eExpenses again and edit your claim / provide additional
    information. Even if you have a conversation about the claim, make
    sure you record all the details here, otherwise the claim may be
    knocked back by central finance.

NB: if your expense is in a foreign currency, you should claim the
actual cost in £. The easiest way to do this is to attached a redacted
(removing any private information) copy of your bank statement / credit
card statement with the actual payment listed. You can claim for the
cost of the item and any bank fees associated with the transaction --
just add these up and put them through as a single claim item.

through Key Travel!*

Definitions of UoE expenses terminology and systems
---------------------------------------------------

*By Lizzy Kirkham & Sue FW*

### Finance Codes

**Account code:** the type of expenditure or income. Account codes are
4-digit numbers. You can look up account codes
[here](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=Finance&title=eFinancials+Account+Code+Finder).

Different account codes are used to mark out money which has been spent
on Travel, or Salaries or Consumables. If you spend money on Travel from
a R-**job code** it will be a different 4-digit code to if you spend
money on Travel from a D-**job code**.

Note that you can only use an account code if it has a **job code**
attached to it. In other words, you need to be assigning your Travel
(Account Code) expenses to a specific pot of money (Job Code).

**Cost centre:** the part of the University that holds the specific
**Job Code** (see below) you are using. The Psychiatry Cost Centre is
214PSY. Cost Centres are all 6-digits long and have a combination of
letters and numbers. Most grants awarded to PIs in Psychiatry will be in
this Cost Centre. In the real world, the Cost Centre is something like
your Sort Code on your personal bank account.

**Job code:** the code for the budget (i.e. "pot of money") you are
using. This is like your bank account number. Job codes start with a
letter, and the letter is meaningful. D is for donation accounts --
which apply if you have funding from a private donor. R is for Research
accounts -- which apply if you have a research grant. G is for general
accounts like the departmental fund for Psychiatry.

### Grant costing terminology

**Costings** are estimates of how much it will cost to do the project.

**Direct costs** are things that won't be paid for you if don't win the
grant. An example would be the salary of someone who would be recruited
to do the work on the grant, or consumables and equipment that will be
bought with the grant money if you win it. Sometimes these can be split
into **directly incurred** and **directly allocated.** The latter are
costs that are being assigned to the project. Salaries of staff already
employed by the University are a good example of this -- the salary is
being paid by the University regardless of whether you win the grant,
but if you get the funding a proportion of this person's time (and an
associated proportion of their salary) is being *allocated* to the
grant. E.g. the ESRC pay for 5% of my salary and I give them 5% of my
working week.

**Indirect costs** are costs that the University will be paying for
whether or not you get the grant. Sometimes, depending on the funder,
the example above (existing staff salaries) count as indirect costs.
Other kinds of indirect costs include things like the University's
electricity and gas bill, the costs of the Library, HR department and
central admin.

**Full economic costing** is the estimated total cost of carrying out
the research. This includes all the things you ask the funder to pay for
(e.g. RA salary, questionnaires, participant expenses) plus all the
indirect costs. Different funders will pay different proportions of
indirect costs.

### Other Terminology

**Approved Supplier:** An approved supplier is someone or something (an
organisation) that the University have decided is a legitimate provider
of good and services. You can ask a finance officer for lists of
approved suppliers (e.g. all the companies that are approved to provide
transcription services) or ask them to check whether a specific person /
company is already an approved supplier. If the company you want to use
is not an approved supplier, you can request that the company you want
to use gets approved. There's information below on how to do this.

For an individual to become an approved supplier they need to be
self-employed and able to demonstrate that. There's more about this
below in the section on How to pay external consultants / providers

**Consumables:** most of the things you purchase for a research grant
will be classed as Consumables. These are any items you buy and expect
to "use up" over the course of the project. Examples might be
questionnaire response forms, or gift vouchers for participants. Even
things you won't literally use up might come under this category -- e.g.
toys, or a manual for a specific psychological assessment. Imagine you
lost the item -- would you claim it on insurance, or just buy a new one?
If the latter, it's consumable.

Anything more expensive / permanent is classed as **Equipment.** This
includes most IT, and things like eye-trackers.

**Purchase Order:** A purchase order is essential a request for some
sort of paid service / supply. Finance officers can raise a purchase
order for specific items. For example, you might request a purchase
order for a specific number of hours of an external academic's time.
Many external providers -- like other Universities, or the NHS -- need a
Purchase Order before they can then send an invoice (i.e. a bill) for
the service provided.

Purchase Orders provide a number of advantages. They get the transaction
added to the system, so now there is a reference associated with that
item. They also give your finance officer a chance to raise any concerns
they might have early in the process. You have a chance to check that
the service being provided is from an approved supplier and that all
their paperwork is in order.

**Subsistence:** this is the term used to describe the costs of being
away from home. Subsistence expenses basically normally means meals,
when you're away at a conference. You might also class local travel
(e.g. bus or metro journeys) under this umbrella. Subsistence can also
describe some of the costs of hosting visitors -- like catering for a
meeting or taking a guest out for dinner.

### Systems

**eExpenses** is an online system for claiming back expenses that you
have personally incurred in the course of your work. Examples might be
meals while away at a conference, or buying some toys for a research
study. There's information above on how to use eExpenses.

**Webfirst** is an online system for checking balances, transactions,
expenditure and income for specific Job Codes. You need to request
access to specific Job Codes by emailing Val Renton. [You can access
WebFirst here](https://www.webfirst.fin.ed.ac.uk/). WebFirst prompts you
to choose from a range of different types of reports on the left hand
side of the page -- e.g. all transactions in a specific period, or a
round-up of total spending to date. The report names are quite hard to
understand and so they are very hard to decide between! [There are
descriptions
here.](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/Finance/WebFirst+-+Available+Reports)
If you find a report format that is useful, it's worth saving it in your
Favourites / making a note to access it again!

**Worktribe** is the University's research management and administration
system. It is used to administer every stage of a research project. You
can read a bit more about Worktribe with some useful links on page 7.

How to pay participants
-----------------------

**Option 1 -- Gift vouchers**

*By Bérengère Digard*

Gift vouchers can be ordered by Ken at one of the University-approved
suppliers ([High Street Vouchers](https://www.highstreetvouchers.com/)
or [Love 2 Shop](https://www.love2shop.co.uk/)). To do so, just email
Ken (copying Sue in) the relevant details: supplier, quantity, amount, G
code. If you need these vouchers quickly, you can order them yourself
and simply claim them back via eExpenses.

You can also buy vouchers yourself from the Post Office or Amazon, and
claim them back (Amazon is not a University-approved supplier, so you
cannot ask Ken to order them for you) via eExpenses.

How to pay external consultants / providers
-------------------------------------------

*By Sue FW*

NB: copies of all the documents listed below should be available in the
DART Resources folder under Finance. Do check you have the latest copy
of the form before you send it to an external provider for completion.

**Option 1**: If the consultant is self-employed they can be added as an
approved supplier, and then invoice the University for their services.
The steps are:

1. The consultant must complete a Supplier Self-Declaration Form, and
   provide HMRC confirmation that they are registered for
   self-assessment, plus details of their bank account and registered
   VAT number (if they have one)

2. You must complete an Employment Status questionnaire, and an
   Engagement of Services Agreement. These explain what you asking the
   external provider to do and lay out the University's legal
   obligations to them as a new "employee". This is essentially in lieu
   of a proper contract of employment. It is a useful process to go
   through.

3. The documents need to be sent to payroll for approval (by your local
   finance officer) -- they in turn send them to HMRC for confirmation
   so it takes a while

4. After confirmation is received from HMRC and Payroll, the provider
   can be added to the Approved Suppliers list.

5. They can then invoice the University and receive payment.

**Option 2:** If the consultant is not self-employed they can be paid
**once in a tax year** using an "Ad-Hoc Payment Form-100". They need to
complete the form, and present their passport to Human Resources at the
University -- the passport has to be presented in person, a copy will
not be accepted.

It is worth asking any external consultants to review the form in
advance to check they are happy to share this kind of information. If
they have questions, these statements from HR might be helpful:

> **Form 100 --- equality information:** The University is obliged to
> collect data to on the equality \[protected\] characteristics of
> employees to comply with statutory legislative reporting requirements
> under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) (Scotland)
> Regulations 2012. Additionally, the University is required by the
> Further and Higher Education Act 1992 to submit statistical returns to
> the Higher Education Statistics Agency \[HESA\]. Currently we are
> required to return annual staff data on sex, race/ethnicity,
> disability and age, under category labels set down by HESA. You are
> not obliged to provide this information to us but it helps the
> University to consider whether the diversity of our employees fully
> reflects society, and to identify and remove barriers to employment.
>
> **Passport check:** The University is required, by the Home Office UK
> Visas and Immigration rules (Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act
> 2006) to verify the 'right to work' of any person who undertakes any
> work at the University of Edinburgh, including those who are British
> or from the European Economic Area (EEA).  This is irrespective of the
> length or nature of your employment, and means that the University
> must carry out document checks on people before employing them to make
> sure they are allowed to work in the UK. Failure of the University to
> comply with these requirements would result in the University being
> fined or, more importantly, losing the right to employ individuals who
> are not nationals of the EEA.

**Option 3:** If the consultant is a member of a steering committee /
reference group for a study, the easiest way to pay them as is a
subsistence payment for each meeting they attend.

Booking travel through the University
-------------------------------------

### Key Travel

*NEEDS SOMETHING ABOUT KEY TRAVEL HERE*

### Booking AirBnBs

The University's expenses policy allows for AirBnB bookings, and there
is more in the travel and accommodation FAQs for the [**New Expenses
Policy section**](https://www.ed.ac.uk/finance/for-staff/financial-regulations-policies-and-procedures/new-expenses-policy/expenses-faqs-travel-and-accommodation-expenses).  **[However]{.underline}**,
some grant providers have issues with projects using Airbnb so contact
your grant manager and check that they (the funder) are happy to cover
these costs.

**Also please** note that:

- Airbnb is not regulated and may fail to meet basic safety
standards such as smoke detection, electrical testing, extinguishers and
fire escape.

- Airbnb is highly unlikely to share traveller information with
the University in the event of an emergency.

- Airbnb hosts sometimes cancel at the last minute for various
reasons and UoE insurance will not cover any direct or indirect costs
associated with that. Airbnb hosts may have no insurance and their
normal domestic insurance may not cover them for letting rooms.

- Airbnb hosts may trade illegally if the host city, for
instance, does not permit short-term room rentals. The accommodation may
be an unused back bedroom in a stranger's house. The accommodation will
often be less secure than a hotel, with no CCTV, key control, robust
door locks, swipe access or room safe. Travellers should wherever
possible favour accommodation where it has smoke detection and good
locks / security.

- Airbnb bookings may be illegal if the country / region / city
/ building does not permit short-term room rentals, or if the host has
not complied with local regulations but nonetheless advertises the
property on the platform regardless.

 In order to avoid some of these problems, travellers can use the Airbnb
platform ONLY where:

- You can identify that the country / city / region / building
permits short-term lets and the property complies with local
regulations, so the booking is legal.

- There is a reasonably full history of positive reviews

- The accommodation is a self-contained apartment (so you aren't
staying in a stranger's back bedroom or similar).

- You can identify the neighbourhood as safe.

- You don't rely only on the Airbnb bookings calendar, but also
email the host directly, as some hosts are not assiduous about updating
calendars.

- You leave full contact details in your travel plan including
location of the apartment and owner contact details.

Please remember to have a valid insurance policy, which you can arrange
free of charge via [**the Insurance
Office**](https://www.ed.ac.uk/finance/about/sections/insurance). 

Ordering consumables and equipment through the University
---------------------------------------------------------

*By Sue FW*

**In most cases:** Please email Sue D with order requests and copy in
Sue FW.  Sue D will action these orders on the assumption that cc-ing
SFW indicates approval.  Please (obviously) make sure you discuss orders
with me in advance.  Anything over £200 threshold will need written
approval from SFW, not just a cc.
