## General information about financial transactions within CCBS

_by Sue FW_

The following gives an overview of financial systems within CCBS: [CCBS information for everyone.](https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/staff-only/ccbs-information-everyone)

## Tips for doing a financial transaction

**1. Submit the request on the appropriate form**

UoE forms can be downloaded from [www.ed.ac.uk/finance/for-staff/forms](http://www.ed.ac.uk/finance/for-staff/forms)

**Tip**: Search for "finance forms" on the University website to download the correct form each time rather than save local copies, which might go out of date.

The purchasing request form is CCBS-specific and can be downloaded from
the CCBS website Staff Only pages at [www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/staff-only/ccbs-information-everyone](http://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/staff-only/ccbs-information-everyone)

**2. Fill in _all_ the details _before_ submitting to your finance officer or local contact**

Make sure that the UoE finance code is fully completed, and all relevant
contact name and addresses have been supplied. Your local contact will
normally be **Sue Davidson**.

UoE finance codes are made up of three parts, and all three are needed
for a transaction.

e.g.

| 217CHA | 3138 | R12345 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cost Centre - this is like the sort code; it's specific to the individual or research group. | Account code - this identifies the category of the purchase/sale, for instance 3138 refers to Research Consumables, 3432 is for Postage | Job code* - this is like the account number |

\*The initial letter of the job code refers to the type of account: R = research grant; D = donation; G = general

'R' job codes have a restricted set of account codes that can be used, according to what you applied for in your grant. (Please don't pair an R job code with an account code that doesn't apply to that grant).

Please look up on webfirst and keep a note of which account codes can be paired with which R numbers. If you don't have access to you job code on webfirst, please contact the Centre Manager.

'D' job codes can also be restricted, if a restriction has been specified in the donation agreement.

'G' job codes can be used with any account code.

**3. Obtain authorisation from the PI/budget holder _before_ submitting**

This will normally be Sue FW.

**4. Submit your request to** [**ccbs-orders@ed.ac.uk **](mailto:ccbs-orders@ed.ac.uk "mailto:ccbs-orders@ed.ac.uk")- **this is** **the shared email for the core finance team (Erika, Rokas, Caroline)**

Please don't copy in other people who might be able to help. This can cause confusion over responsibilities and often slows things up.

The email will be picked up by either Rokas Stonys or Caroline MacDonald, our Finance Administrators. They will normally respond within 2 working days, either to confirm that the request has been actioned or, for more complex requests, to acknowledge receipt.

**5. Please be patient - wait at least 3 days before following up**

## Specific transaction types within CCBS

**Purchase orders** (PO): Please fill a purchasing request form (download from CCBS website) and send one email with all the details available for your product including full grant coding. If you don't know the details, please ask your PI, and obtain their full authorisation.

**Invoices:** Please send only one email with a scan of the invoice and grant codes once you get authorisation from PI. Please check if invoices have a contact email and bank details, and provide these details if they are not stated on the invoice.

**Expenses for non-staff:** Complete the 'Payment for non-staff / non-students expenses' form and submit it once you have PI approval and signature and all all the grant coding has been added. Please complete the form with full address and bank details. Please also send an email from the non-staff member confirming their bank details as Accounts Payable will need to see this email.

**Suppliers that are not in our system:** The supplier will need to completes the 'Supplier Self-Declaration form' and provide a headed company letter with full bank details including bank address.

**International payments:** Please send the invoice with all above details including full grant coding.

**Internal Transfers**: Please send the School and Sub-Unit and the name of the authoriser plus grant codes and explain clearly if this is to pay for something or to receive a payment

**Sales invoices**: Please request a PO from the customer and provide full grant details

## How to use WebFirst

_By Sue FW_

**Webfirst** is an online system for checking balances, transactions, expenditure and income for specific Job Codes. You need to request access to specific Job Codes by emailing Val Renton. [You can access WebFirst here](https://www.webfirst.fin.ed.ac.uk/).

WebFirst prompts you to choose from a range of different types of reports on the left-hand side of the page -- e.g. all transactions in a specific period, or a round-up of total spending to date. The report names are quite hard to understand and so they are very hard to decide between! [There are descriptions here.](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/Finance/WebFirst+-+Available+Reports)

If you find a report format that is useful, it's worth saving it in your Favourites / making a note to access it again!

## How to make an expense claim

#### Staff: People & Money

\[information needed\]

#### Students: Claims form

For reasons unknown to us mere mortals, the powers that be have decided that (most) students do not need access to People & Money. Instead:

1. Fill out the "Student Expenses Claim Form" from the [expenses page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/finance/for-staff/forms).
2. Make sure you have all the receipts compiled into a single document, complete with currency exchanges if needs be. The easiest way to do this is put images of all the receipts into a word document, and label them all with a) what the expense is (e.g. "Dinner night 1", "Taxi fare"), b) the price on the receipt, and c) the price exchanged into GBP, if it's originally in another currency.
3. Send both form and receipts doc to Sue D., who will make sure it gets to the right person.

## Definitions of UoE expenses terminology and systems

_by Lizzy Kirkham & Sue FW_

### Finance Codes

{OUT OF DATE PLEASE AMEND\]

**Account code:** the type of expenditure or income. Account codes are 4-digit numbers. You can look up account codes [here](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=Finance&title=eFinancials+Account+Code+Finder).

Different account codes are used to mark out money which has been spent on Travel, or Salaries or Consumables. If you spend money on Travel from a R-**job code** it will be a different 4-digit code to if you spend money on Travel from a D-**job code**.

Note that you can only use an account code if it has a **job code** attached to it. In other  words, you need to be assigning your Travel (Account Code) expenses to a specific pot of  money (Job Code).

**Cost centre:** the part of the University that holds the specific **Job Code** (see below) you are using. The Psychiatry Cost Centre is 214PSY. Cost Centres are all 6-digits long and have a combination of letters and numbers. Most grants awarded to PIs in Psychiatry will be in this Cost Centre. In the real world, the Cost Centre is something like your Sort Code on your personal bank account.

**Job code:** the code for the budget (i.e. "pot of money") you are using. This is like your bank account number. Job codes start with a letter, and the letter is meaningful. D is for donation accounts -- which apply if you have funding from a private donor. R is for Research accounts -- which apply if you have a research grant. G is for general accounts like the departmental fund for Psychiatry.

### Grant costing terminology

**Costings** are estimates of how much it will cost to do the project.

**Direct costs** are things that won't be paid for you if don't win the grant. An example would be the salary of someone who would be recruited to do the work on the grant, or consumables and equipment that will be bought with the grant money if you win it. Sometimes these can be split into **directly incurred** and **directly allocated.** The latter are costs that are being assigned to the project. Salaries of staff already employed by the University are a good example of this -- the salary is being paid by the University regardless of whether you win the grant, but if you get the funding a proportion of this person's time (and an associated proportion of their salary) is being _allocated_ to the grant. E.g. the ESRC pay for 5% of my salary and I give them 5% of my working week.

**Indirect costs** are costs that the University will be paying for whether or not you get the grant. Sometimes, depending on the funder, the example above (existing staff salaries) count as indirect costs. Other kinds of indirect costs include things like the University's electricity and gas bill, the costs of the Library, HR department and central admin.

**Full economic costing** is the estimated total cost of carrying out the research. This includes all the things you ask the funder to pay for (e.g. RA salary, questionnaires, participant expenses) plus all the indirect costs. Different funders will pay different proportions of indirect costs.

### Other Terminology

**Approved Supplier:** An approved supplier is someone or something (an organisation) that the University have decided is a legitimate provider of good and services. You can ask a finance officer for lists of approved suppliers (e.g. all the companies that are approved to provide transcription services) or ask them to check whether a specific person / company is already an approved supplier. If the company you want to use is not an approved supplier, you can request that the company you want to use gets approved. There's information below on how to do this.

For an individual to become an approved supplier they need to be self-employed and able to demonstrate that. There's more about this below in the section on How to pay external consultants / providers

**Consumables:** most of the things you purchase for a research grant will be classed as Consumables. These are any items you buy and expect to "use up" over the course of the project. Examples might be questionnaire response forms, or gift vouchers for participants. Even things you won't literally use up might come under this category -- e.g. toys, or a manual for a specific psychological assessment. Imagine you lost the item -- would you claim it on insurance, or just buy a new one? If the latter, it's consumable.

Anything more expensive / permanent is classed as **Equipment.** This includes most IT, and things like eye-trackers.

**Purchase Order:** A purchase order is essential a request for some sort of paid service / supply. Finance officers can raise a purchase order for specific items. For example, you might request a purchase order for a specific number of hours of an external academic's time. Many external providers -- like other Universities, or the NHS -- need a Purchase Order before they can then send an invoice (i.e. a bill) for the service provided.

Purchase Orders provide a number of advantages. They get the transaction added to the system, so now there is a reference associated with that item. They also give your finance officer a chance to raise any concerns they might have early in the process. You have a chance to check that the service being provided is from an approved supplier and that all their paperwork is in order.

**Subsistence:** this is the term used to describe the costs of being away from home. Subsistence expenses basically normally means meals, when you're away at a conference. You might also class local travel (e.g. bus or metro journeys) under this umbrella. Subsistence can also describe some of the costs of hosting visitors -- like catering for a meeting or taking a guest out for dinner.

### Systems

**eExpenses** has been replaced by People & Money.

**People & Money** does everything from expenses to HR to holiday time booking. PhD students do not currently have access to it, so I (a PhD student) cannot help you here.

**Webfirst** is an online system for checking balances, transactions, expenditure and income for specific Job Codes. You need to request access to specific Job Codes by emailing Val Renton. [You can access WebFirst here](https://www.webfirst.fin.ed.ac.uk/). WebFirst prompts you to choose from a range of different types of reports on the left hand side of the page -- e.g. all transactions in a specific period, or a round-up of total spending to date. The report names are quite hard to understand and so they are very hard to decide between! [There are descriptions here.](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/Finance/WebFirst+-+Available+Reports) If you find a report format that is useful, it's worth saving it in your Favourites / making a note to access it again!

**Worktribe** is the University's research management and administration system. It is used to administer every stage of a research project. You can read a bit more about Worktribe with some useful links on page 7.

## Using petty cash

Just don't.

# Travel

## Booking travel through the University

### Diversity Travel

The UoE has a new (in 2022) travel contract with [Diversity Travel](https://www.diversitytravel.com/uk/what-we-do/). You can book travel direct through them and it will be charged onto a grant job code, which means you are never out of pocket. You can ask them to search for journeys for you, or you can tell them the specific flights / hotels etc that you want. You can also give them a budget limit, if you only have a specific amount of funding available. There is an [online booking tool at this link](https://idp.diversitytravel.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fconnect%2Fauthorize%2Fcallback%3Fresponse_type%3Did_token%2520token%26client_id%3Dgatewaysystem%26state%3DUCONDxsvkByc5EoUAZZuGRVjQKiYBK_X5O7S1Vg587kxH%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgateway.diversitytravel.com%252Fhome%26scope%3Dopenid%2520profile%2520offline_access%2520gatewayapi%26nonce%3DUCONDxsvkByc5EoUAZZuGRVjQKiYBK_X5O7S1Vg587kxH).

### Booking your own travel

You can also book your own travel and claim it back. This is not the University's recommended or preferred option, and it can also mean you may be out of pocket for a period of time while you wait for your expense claim to be paid. But it is still allowed and sometimes it may be the right option for you.

### Booking AirBnBs

The University's expenses policy allows for AirBnB bookings, and there is more in the travel and accommodation FAQs for the [**Expenses Policy section**](https://www.ed.ac.uk/finance/for-staff/financial-regulations-policies-and-procedures/expenses-policy).  **However**, some grant providers have issues with projects using Airbnb so contact your grant manager and check that they (the funder) are happy to cover these costs.

**Also please** note that:

* Airbnb is not regulated and may fail to meet basic safety standards such as smoke detection, electrical testing, extinguishers and fire escape.
* Airbnb is highly unlikely to share traveller information with the University in the event of an emergency.
* Airbnb hosts sometimes cancel at the last minute for various reasons and UoE insurance will not cover any direct or indirect costs associated with that. Airbnb hosts may have no insurance and their normal domestic insurance may not cover them for letting rooms.
* Airbnb hosts may trade illegally if the host city, for instance, does not permit short-term room rentals. The accommodation may be an unused back bedroom in a stranger's house. The accommodation will often be less secure than a hotel, with no CCTV, key control, robust door locks, swipe access or room safe. Travellers should wherever possible favour accommodation where it has smoke detection and good locks / security.
* Airbnb bookings may be illegal if the country / region / city / building does not permit short-term room rentals, or if the host has not complied with local regulations but nonetheless advertises the property on the platform regardless.

In order to avoid some of these problems, travellers can use the Airbnb platform ONLY where:

* You can identify that the country / city / region / building permits short-term lets and the property complies with local regulations, so the booking is legal.
* There is a reasonably full history of positive reviews
* The accommodation is a self-contained apartment (so you aren't staying in a stranger's back bedroom or similar).
* You can identify the neighbourhood as safe.
* You don't rely only on the Airbnb bookings calendar, but also email the host directly, as some hosts are not assiduous about updating calendars.
* You leave full contact details in your travel plan including location of the apartment and owner contact details.

### Travel Insurance

Please remember to have a valid insurance policy, which you can arrange free of charge via [**the Insurance Office**](https://www.ed.ac.uk/finance/about/sections/insurance). This can be done by completing an online form:

* [Travel insurance application form for students ](https://www.ed.ac.uk/finance/about/sections/insurance/travel-insurance/how-do-i-apply "Student insurance application form")
* [Travel insurance appliation form for staff](https://www.ed.ac.uk/staff/business-travel/travel-insurance/insurance-application-form "Staff insurance application form")

When completing your insurance form, you will need to upload a **risk assessment form** and/or **travel plan**. These forms can be found on [this webpage](https://www.ed.ac.uk/staff/business-travel/travel-safety/risk-assessments-travel-plan "Risk Assessment Info"), along with more information. When applying for insurance for international travel, you will need to complete **both forms.** For local travel, **just the travel plan** will suffice. You can get the forms signed by sending them to Sue D susan.davidson@ed.ac.uk

## Travel expenses and booking conference or work travel

1. The University's [Sustainable Travel Policy](https://www.ed.ac.uk/sustainability/what-we-do/travel/climate-conscious-travel/sustainable-travel-policy-2021 "https://www.ed.ac.uk/sustainability/what-we-do/travel/climate-conscious-travel/sustainable-travel-policy-2021")
2. We're using a new travel management company - [Diversity Travel](https://www.diversitytravel.com/uk/ "https://www.diversitytravel.com/uk/") - to book travel and accommodation for University business.

From 1 March 2022, the new travel booking system can be accessed via Diversity Travel:

[Log in to Diversity Travel](https://idp.diversitytravel.com/account/login "https://idp.diversitytravel.com/account/login")

On this date, all staff who have previously booked travel either for themselves or on behalf of others will receive an email from Diversity Travel giving them access to the new system.

The policy also supports staff wellbeing by encouraging us to only undertake necessary travel, and promotes inclusion via an “exceptions” mechanism to ensure that no-one with caring responsibilities, disabilities, or other exceptional circumstances is negatively affected by the policy change. Policy headlines include:

* reducing the overall number of journeys in favour of virtual collaboration tools
* if travel is necessary, favouring low carbon transport options
* a presumption against air travel within mainland Great Britain
* the default class for air travel is economy, with premium tickets reserved for disability or for other health-related reasons

**Can I pay for travel myself and then expense it back?**

Public transport fares and taxis may be refunded via expenses for short and infrequent journeys. You can also claim back incidental expenses incurred while travelling via expenses.

**Flights and accommodation cannot be expensed; please pre-book these.**

The University will not reimburse the cost of ordinary commuting or private travel.

Find out more by reading the University’s Expenses Policy.

## What can be claimed as a travel expense?

![](/uploads/expenses_infograph.png)

# Paying People

## How to pay participants

### Option 1: Gift vouchers

_by Bérengère Digard_

Gift vouchers can be ordered by Ken at one of the University-approved suppliers ([High Street Vouchers](https://www.highstreetvouchers.com/) or [Love 2 Shop](https://www.love2shop.co.uk/)). To do so, just email Ken (copying Sue in) the relevant details: supplier, quantity, amount, G code. If you need these vouchers quickly, you can order them yourself and simply claim them back via eExpenses.

You can also buy vouchers yourself from the Post Office or Amazon, and claim them back (Amazon is not a University-approved supplier, so you cannot ask Ken to order them for you) via eExpenses.

### Option 2: Don't

Most of the other options are pretty terrible. Just use vouchers.

## How to pay external consultants / providers

_by Sue FW_

**NB:** copies of all the documents listed below should be available in the DART Resources folder under Finance. Do check you have the latest copy of the form before you send it to an external provider for completion.

### Option 1: Approved Supplier

If the consultant is self-employed they can be added as an approved supplier, and then invoice the University for their services. The steps are:

1. The consultant must complete a Supplier Self-Declaration Form, and provide HMRC confirmation that they are registered for self-assessment, plus details of their bank account and registered VAT number (if they have one)
2. You must complete an Employment Status questionnaire, and an Engagement of Services Agreement. These explain what you asking the external provider to do and lay out the University's legal obligations to them as a new "employee". This is essentially in lieu of a proper contract of employment. It is a useful process to go through.
3. The documents need to be sent to payroll for approval (by your local finance officer) -- they in turn send them to HMRC for confirmation so it takes a while
4. After confirmation is received from HMRC and Payroll, the provider can be added to the Approved Suppliers list.
5. They can then invoice the University and receive payment.

### Option 2: Ad Hoc Payment

If the consultant is not self-employed they can be paid **once in a tax year** using an "Ad-Hoc Payment Form-100". They need to complete the form, and present their passport to Human Resources at the University -- the passport has to be presented in person, a copy will not be accepted.

It is worth asking any external consultants to review the form in advance to check they are happy to share this kind of information. If they have questions, these statements from HR might be helpful:

> **Form 100 --- equality information:** The University is obliged to collect data to on the equality \[protected\] characteristics of employees to comply with statutory legislative reporting requirements under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) (Scotland) Regulations 2012. Additionally, the University is required by the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 to submit statistical returns to the Higher Education Statistics Agency \[HESA\]. Currently we are required to return annual staff data on sex, race/ethnicity, disability and age, under category labels set down by HESA. You are not obliged to provide this information to us but it helps the University to consider whether the diversity of our employees fully reflects society, and to identify and remove barriers to employment.
>
> **Passport check:** The University is required, by the Home Office UK Visas and Immigration rules (Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006) to verify the 'right to work' of any person who undertakes any work at the University of Edinburgh, including those who are British or from the European Economic Area (EEA).  This is irrespective of the length or nature of your employment, and means that the University must carry out document checks on people before employing them to make sure they are allowed to work in the UK. Failure of the University to comply with these requirements would result in the University being fined or, more importantly, losing the right to employ individuals who are not nationals of the EEA.

### Option 3: Subsistence Payment

If the consultant is a member of a steering committee / reference group for a study, the easiest way to pay them as is a subsistence payment for each meeting they attend.

## Ordering consumables and equipment through the University

_By Sue FW_

**In most cases:** Please email Sue D with order requests and copy in Sue FW.  Sue D will action these orders on the assumption that cc-ing SFW indicates approval. Please (obviously) make sure you discuss orders with me in advance.  

Anything over £200 threshold will need written approval from SFW, not just a cc.
