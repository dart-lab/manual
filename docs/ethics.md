Ethics
======

R&D, Sponsorship, and Ethics: definitions and process
-----------------------------------------------------

1. **Sponsorship** is the University's review to **check that your research
is properly insured** and review the University's liability. This should
happen FIRST. For example, what if you invite a participant to a
University building, and they trip on a loose carpet corner and hurt
themselves? The University would be liable for this, and so they want to
know that all significant risks have been minimised. This includes risks
like failure to take consent.

::: tip Tips
- Generic research governance review for insurance and liability purposes.
- Submit your protocol, participant information sheet, and consent form
- If you are planning an NHS ethics proposal, you can also send your IRAS
  (online ethics) form.
- When you send your project information to the sponsor, they will let you know
  what nest steps are advised -but you can also tell them which ethics committee
  you think most appropriate.

2. **Ethics** is the process of evaluating that your research doesn't
infringe human rights, and that you follow core ethical research
practices such as informed consent and data confidentiality. This
normally happens SECOND.

::: tip Tips
- Human rights review.
- Your sponsor may recommend a specific ethics committee.
- The ethics committee will have a specific application form and you can copy
  and paste a lot of the content from your protocol to that form.
- They will also want to see your information sheet(s) and consent form.

3. **R&D review** is designed **to evaluate the impact of your project on
NHS resources**. If required, R&D review will happen THIRD. However,
your project might need to be checked by R&D at the time you apply for
funding, to see whether you need to include budget for NHS resources. It
might also need an R&D review after funding has been awarded, to see if
it impacts the NHS in any way. If your project has zero impact on the
NHS then you won't take this any further. If you are using NHS resources
(e.g. recruiting from patient lists, involving nurse time, posting
recruitment adverts in GP surgeries), then R&D approval is needed to
permit access to these resources.

::: tip Tips
- NHS impact review.
- If you are submitting to NHS ethics, you will also submit your application
  simultaneously to R&D.
- R&D don't require any additional or separate materials.

4. The **Caldicott Guardian** scheme is designed to make sure patient data
collected for clinical purposes is protected. You will need to apply to
the scheme, after your regular ethics is completed, if you want to
access any patient data. This includes patient names and addresses, as
well as diagnostic information, routine test results etc.

::: tip Tips
- Review of patient data security.
- The Caldicott Guardian scheme is about protecting patient data.
- If you are using patient data- including names and addresses from clinic
  lists, or re-analysis of routine data, you will need to have your application
  approved by the Calidcott Guardian.

Things to think about when writing an ethics proposal

Autistica have made a great Research Toolkit that contains sample
information sheets, consent forms and other materials for sharing with
research participants. You can [check it out

Making information accessible to people with a learning disability
------------------------------------------------------------------

It's important that your information sheets are accessible to people who
are going to read them. If your study includes people with a learning
disability, [this guide from NHS England might
help](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/LearningDisabilityAccessCommsGuidance.pdf).
Here's the [Easy Read version of the same
guide](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/make-it-easy-easy-read.pdf).

A short guide to various ethics forms
-------------------------------------

*By Bérengère Digard*

### *PPLS Ethics*

If your study fits under the Psychology umbrella (even if it involves
imaging or biosamples) and if you have a supervisor / collaborator in
PPLS, you might be able to submit your ethics in PPLS. In case of
doubts, ask your supervisor / collaborator / the actual ethics
committee. The Ethics application process in PPLS is quite quick and
straight-forward.

1. The online website <https://resource.ppls.ed.ac.uk/ethics/> is
straight-forward in spite of its vintage look. You can easily save your
form and come back to it later. You have to upload all the relevant
documents (Participant Information Sheet, Recruitment flyer, Consent
Form -- You can also add a Data Management Plan but it's not mandatory)
at the end, on the last page (possibly even after having clicked on
"submit".

2. Once the online form is submitted, your collaborators will receive
an email inviting them to review it and (electronically) sign it.

3. Once all the collaborators have signed the form, it goes to the
ethics committee. The decision comes back within 2 weeks via email, with
the Approval letter or with the Review Comments (once I submitted a form
in the morning and got the letter on the same day in the afternoon).

4. If you need to change some details based on the Review Comments, of
if you need to make amendments later, you can easily access the form
again in your PPLS Ethics account to edit the form and re-submit it.
While doing so you can click on "Compare Previous" to keep track and
compare the different versions of the form. You can also upload a
document (on the same page as the other relevant documents) explaining
to the committee the changes you've made, and/or answering the questions
raised in the Review Comments.

### *NHS Ethics, ACCORD, all that jazz* :trumpet:

This path is required for imaging studies. It is long, it is complex,
I'm still entirely unable to give you a nice flowchart of all the steps
to follow. This Ethics path is fraught with pitfalls and is only
surpassed by Frodo's journey to Mordor.
