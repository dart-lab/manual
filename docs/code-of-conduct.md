# DART Principles

## _happiness at work and excellence in research_

### 1. **Kindness** :v:

_At the DART lab we value camaraderie. We are generous to each other, and to everyone we encounter in our work. We take good care of our shared spaces and resources. We are forgiving._ 

### 2. Inclusivity :rainbow:

_We work hard to make our workplace and our research inclusive. We educate ourselves to recognise and accept differences between people. We try not to rush to judgement, make assumptions or impose our personal norms. We integrate community perspectives in meaningful and empowered ways._ 

### 3. Learning

_We are always learning. We strive for excellence, but our workplace is also a safe space to be vulnerable, and to learn new things. We take the time to develop our research and academic practice, and to share what we learn with others. We share resources and explain things to each other patiently._ 

### 4. Quality

_We are creative and inventive, but also procedurally rigorous. We are deliberate and thoughtful in our planning. We are deeply ethical. We are conscientious record-keepers. We are proud of our study designs, not our p-values._ 

### 5. Transparency :open_hands:

_We are honest about our work and its challenges. We value open dialogue and shared knowledge-creation. We share the process as well as the outcome. We engage with critical debate and feedback with an open mind._ 

### 6. Impact 

_We aim to make a positive difference. Sometimes this means resources of information for use in the community. Sometimes this means methods, analyses or ideas for researchers within and beyond our field. We communicate about our work in a way that is relevant and accessible to the audience._ 

### 7. Boundaries :speech_balloon:

_We plan ahead realistically, communicate those plans, and include time off. We try to make our requests reasonable, and don't trespass on others' goodwill. We say No when we need to focus on our own work, our family & friends, or ourselves._
