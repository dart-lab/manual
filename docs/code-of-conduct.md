# The DART Code of Conduct

## _principles for a happy workplace_

### 1. **Be kind** :v:

_At the DART lab we value camaraderie. Be generous to each other, and to
everyone we encounter in our work._

### 2. Be inclusive :rainbow:

_Educate yourself to recognise and accept differences between people.
Try not to rush to judgement, make assumptions or impose your personal
norms._

### 3. Ask for help :phone:

_Our workplace is a safe space to be vulnerable, and to learn new
things. Be attentive to what other people need from you._

### 4. Share :open_hands:

_Share your knowledge - explain things to each other patiently. Take
care of our shared spaces and resources._

### 5. It's OK to say no :speech_balloon:

_Try to make your requests reasonable, and don't trespass on others'
goodwill. Feel free to say No when you need to focus on your own work,
your family & friends, or yourself._
