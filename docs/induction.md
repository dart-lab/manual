# Induction at DART

## Getting started working at DART

_By Saoirse Heron_

Starting work at DART has been a great experience. Everyone is extremely
welcoming and on hand to answer any questions I have had. Even in the
months leading up to commencing my post, I was regularly kept up to date
with what was going on. As a result, I felt prepared when I arrived on
my first day and ready to hit the ground running. My advice to anyone
starting a post at DART is:

* Organise a meeting with Bethany Anderson to take you on a building tour. Not only will this give you an idea of where everything is, but she also kindly provides you with a stationary start-up pack which is always useful. (Bethany's e-mail: bethany.anderson@ed.ac.uk)
* Introduce yourself to staff at the front desk (Alix and Patrice). They set the access codes for the doors which are always useful to know.
* This may not apply to everyone*, but it may be worth taking a trip
  to the Main Library on George Square to get your staff/ student
  card. You can get there easily by bus, with the number 5 and 23
  going from Morningside Road to the Main library.
* Ask questions whenever you need to. Don't be afraid to approach
  someone because if they don't know the answer, they will most
  certainly be able to point you in the direction of someone who does.
* Take the time to find out what everyone is working on. There are
  some interesting projects going on here and you never know,
  someone's experience may be just what you need to help you get
  started.

Overall, getting started at DART is a positive experience and you will
no doubt enjoy your time a part of the team.

\*Addition from Lizzy Kirkham: As a post doc I wasn't able to get my
staff card from the main library. Instead I had to submit a photograph
of myself via this website:
[https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/card/getting-first-card](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/card/getting-first-card).
Once the photo was accepted they then posted my card through the
internal mail. (I did receive instructions through the internal mail on
how to get a staff card but these arrived a few days after the staff
card did!)

_PLEASE ADD ADDITIONAL ITEMS TO THE LIST ABOVE_

Whilst it's not required, the University encourages staff/stuents to create a profile page for the University website. This essentially gives you a free personal website, so it's worth doing! A 'how to' for profile creation, as well as guidance and support, is available [on the CCBS website](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/staff-only/ccbs-information-everyone/creating-profile-pages).

## Essential training for new staff

New staff must complete 4 mandatory online training modules:

**Overcoming Unconscious Bias** **-** To increase understanding of
unconscious bias in the
workplace: [https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/courses/other-courses/elearning/overcoming-unconscious-bias](https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/courses/other-courses/elearning/overcoming-unconscious-bias)

**eDiversity in the Workplace** - To increase your knowledge and
understanding of equality and diversity
issues: [https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/courses/other-courses/elearning/ediversity](https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/courses/other-courses/elearning/ediversity)

**Info security essentials** --To learn the basics about the most common
kinds of attack to information:
[https://www.ed.ac.uk/infosec/learning-about-protection](https://www.ed.ac.uk/infosec/learning-about-protection)

**Data protection** -- To learn about GDPR legislation and data
protection compliance in day-to-day work:
[https://www.ed.ac.uk/infosec/learning-about-protection](https://www.ed.ac.uk/infosec/learning-about-protection)

Depending on your role, you may also have to complete a free, 1-day,
in-person course on **Good Clinical Practice**. This course usually
takes place once a month and needs to be booked in advance on the
Edinburgh CRF website:
[https://www.crts.org.uk/Content.aspx?dbid=crts&layout=CRTS+Master&theme=CRTS&areaid=118&name=Courses Advanced&type=Content&oid=Screen&uirefid=1274](https://www.crts.org.uk/Content.aspx?dbid=crts&layout=CRTS+Master&theme=CRTS&areaid=118&name=Courses%20Advanced&type=Content&oid=Screen&uirefid=1274)

Make sure to keep a copy of your course completion certificate and email
it to your supervisor or study coordinator so it can be added to the
study file.

## How to request annual leave

Updated April 2022, Catherine

\- From 4 April 2022, all leave and absence will be recorded in People and Money.

\- All types of leave and absence (for example, annual leave) will be recorded in P&M. You should ensure you are familiar with the types of leave available and that the leave you are requesting is appropriate. A summary can be found [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/policies-guidance/leave-absence/leave-options "https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/policies-guidance/leave-absence/leave-options"). Once your leave is submitted, it will go to your line manager to approve.

\- Guides and videos are available [here](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/sites/HRandFinanceTransformation/SitePages/payroll-timesheets-job-changes-guidance.aspx "https://uoe.sharepoint.com/sites/HRandFinanceTransformation/SitePages/payroll-timesheets-job-changes-guidance.aspx").

General tips

* If you can, think about how your annual leave fits with the timeline for your project. Try to avoid annual leave at moments which we already know will be busy. That said, don't worry if you can't manage to co-ordinate your personal and work life!
* if you are a PhD student you don't have an official annual leave allowance. However you should still take holidays and it is useful and kind to let your supervisors know in advance!

## General Information about Annual Leave

The University has a Winter/Christmas closure over the Christmas and New
Year period during which only some services operate. Employees who are
not required to work during this closure period must use their Annual
Leave to cover this period, which is normally four days.

Further information is available on the university [HR
page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/policies-guidance/leave-absence)
and the [Leave and Absence Options
page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/policies-guidance/leave-absence/leave-options).

## Reporting sick leave

Updated April 2022: Catherine

From 4 April 2022, all leave and absence will be recorded in People and money

For sickness absence, you should follow your local process for reporting sickness absence. This usually involves phoning your line manager on the first day of your absence, and providing the following information

* The specific reason for absence.
* The length of time they expect to be absent and/or their expected
  return date if known.
* Whether they intend to seek, or have sought medical advice or help.
* Whether there is anything their manager needs to do to reassign
  their work or meetings for the time absent.

Line Manager and staff must also agree how to maintain contact if the absence is expected to last longer than one day, so that we are kept fully aware of the situation.

After any period of absence of up to and including seven calendar days, staff must complete the self-certificate section (Part 1) of a [**Return to Work form**](http://www.docs.csg.ed.ac.uk/HumanResources/forms/Return_to_Work.doc), attached, ideally on the first day back, sending Dorothy Air the completed form.  Managers should have a return to work discussion and complete Part 2 of the form when the absence is longer than seven calendar days.  The member of staff should then hand the completed form and any medical certificates to Dorothy Air.

Forms regarding annual leave, absence, and general work attendence can be found on [this page of the HR website](https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/policies-guidance/leave-absence/absence). For information on how to request time off for medical appointments, how to report absence due to illness/injury, or how the university deals with concerns over work absences, the university's Absence Management Policy is available here: [https://www.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/absence_management_policy.pdf](https://www.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/absence_management_policy.pdf "https://www.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/absence_management_policy.pdf")

## How to get a Research Passport (and what it is for)

_By Saoirse Heron_

For those of you who are carrying out research in collaboration with the NHS, then it is necessary that you obtain a Research Passport. The Research Passport ensures that your pre-employment checks are in line with the NHS Employment Check Standards. Once your Research Passport is approved it remains valid for 3 years and enables you to obtain an Honorary Research contract or Letter of Access for the relevant NHS board.

In order to apply for a Research Passport, the following is required:

* _A Criminal Record Check (PVG)_ -- If you are not already registered
  with the Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) Scheme, then you will
  need to apply for this. However, if you already hold a valid PVG,
  then you will simply need to fill in a Disclosure Permission form
  along with a short section on the Standard Disclosure form and
  return them to the person assisting you with your application.
* _Occupational Health Check_ -- This requires you to fill in and
  return the Occupational Health questionnaire to the person assisting
  you with your application.
* _Research Passport Form_ -- Again, this requires you to fill in and
  return the form to the person assisting you with your application.

In relation to your Honorary Contract you may also need to supply:

* Two forms of ID (one of which must be address based)
* a copy of your CV (each page signed and dated)
* an IT declaration form.

This will all need to be returned to the person assisting you with the
application.

The application process itself is relatively straightforward. However,
it may take some time for your application to be processed and approved,
so be sure to start the process as early as possible.

Here is a useful link to help you get started:

## How to get a mentor (and why)

_By Sue FW_

Mentoring Connections is the staff mentoring programme.

The programme uses an online resource, [Platform
One](http://www.ed.ac.uk/platform-one), enabling Mentors and Mentees to
self-register, self-select and self-manage.  This brings an end to the
need for manual matching or opening and closing windows as the platform
is permanently available.

You can register your profile as a Mentor or Mentee -- or both.  There
is a [help
guide](https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/creating_a_mentor_support_profile_on_platform_one.pdf)
for hints and tips on creating a really impactful profile.
