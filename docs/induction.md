# Getting started working at DART

_By Saoirse Heron_

Starting work at DART has been a great experience. Everyone is extremely welcoming and on hand to answer any questions I have had. Even in the months leading up to commencing my post, I was regularly kept up to date with what was going on. As a result, I felt prepared when I arrived on my first day and ready to hit the ground running. My advice to anyone starting a post at DART is:

* Organise a meeting with Ken O'Neill to take you on a building tour. Not only will this give you an idea of where everything is, but he also kindly provides you with a stationary start-up pack which is always useful. (Ken's e-mail: [v1konei3@exseed.ed.ac.uk](mailto:v1konei3@exseed.ed.ac.uk))
* Introduce yourself to staff at the front desk. They set the access codes for the doors which are always useful to know.
* This may not apply to everyone*, but it may be worth taking a trip to the Main Library on George Square to get your staff/ student card. You can get there easily by bus, with the number 5 and 23 going from Morningside Road to the Main library.
* Ask questions whenever you need to. Don't be afraid to approach someone because if they don't know the answer, they will most certainly be able to point you in the direction of someone who does.
* Take the time to find out what everyone is working on. There are some interesting projects going on here and you never know, someone's experience may be just what you need to help you get started.

Overall, getting started at DART is a positive experience and you will no doubt enjoy your time a part of the team.

_Addition from Lizzy Kirkham:_ As a post doc I wasn't able to get my staff card from the main library. Instead I had to submit a photograph of myself via this website: [https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/card/getting-first-card](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/card/getting-first-card). Once the photo was accepted they then posted my card through the internal mail. (I did receive instructions through the internal mail on how to get a staff card but these arrived a few days after the staff card did!)

## How to get a Research Passport (and what it is for)

_By Saoirse Heron_

For those of you who are carrying out research in collaboration with the NHS, then it is necessary that you obtain a Research Passport. The Research Passport ensures that your pre-employment checks are in line with the NHS Employment Check Standards. Once your Research Passport is approved it remains valid for 3 years and enables you to obtain an Honorary Research contract or Letter of Access for the relevant NHS board.

In order to apply for a Research Passport, the following is required:

* **A Criminal Record Check (PVG)** - If you are not already registered with the Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) Scheme, then you will need to apply for this. However, if you already hold a valid PVG, then you will simply need to fill in a Disclosure Permission form along with a short section on the Standard Disclosure form and return them to the person assisting you with your application.
* **Occupational Health Check** - This requires you to fill in and return the Occupational Health questionnaire to the person assisting you with your application.
* **Research Passport Form** - Again, this requires you to fill in and return the form to the person assisting you with your application.

In relation to your Honorary Contract you may also need to supply:

* Two forms of ID (one of which must be address based)
* A copy of your CV (each page signed and dated)
* An IT declaration form.

This will all need to be returned to the person assisting you with the application.

The application process itself is relatively straightforward. However, it may take some time for your application to be processed and approved, so be sure to start the process as early as possible.

## How to get a mentor (and why)

_By Sue FW_

Mentoring Connections is the staff mentoring programme.

The programme uses an online resource, [Platform One](http://www.ed.ac.uk/platform-one), enabling Mentors and Mentees to self-register, self-select and self-manage.  This brings an end to the need for manual matching or opening and closing windows as the platform is permanently available.

You can register your profile as a Mentor or Mentee -- or both.  There is a [help](https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/creating_a_mentor_support_profile_on_platform_one.pdf) guide for hints and tips on creating a really impactful profile.

If you've got any questions, direct them to this email address: [Mentoring@ed.ac.uk](mailto:Mentoring@ed.ac.uk)
