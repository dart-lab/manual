Induction at DART
=================

Getting started working at DART
-------------------------------

*By Saoirse Heron*

Starting work at DART has been a great experience. Everyone is extremely
welcoming and on hand to answer any questions I have had. Even in the
months leading up to commencing my post, I was regularly kept up to date
with what was going on. As a result, I felt prepared when I arrived on
my first day and ready to hit the ground running. My advice to anyone
starting a post at DART is:

- Organise a meeting with Ken O'Neill to take you on a building tour.
  Not only will this give you an idea of where everything is, but he
  also kindly provides you with a stationary start-up pack which is
  always useful. (Ken's e-mail: <v1konei3@exseed.ed.ac.uk>)

- Introduce yourself to staff at the front desk. They set the access
  codes for the doors which are always useful to know.

- This may not apply to everyone\*, but it may be worth taking a trip
  to the Main Library on George Square to get your staff/ student
  card. You can get there easily by bus, with the number 5 and 23
  going from Morningside Road to the Main library.

- Ask questions whenever you need to. Don't be afraid to approach
  someone because if they don't know the answer, they will most
  certainly be able to point you in the direction of someone who does.

- Take the time to find out what everyone is working on. There are
  some interesting projects going on here and you never know,
  someone's experience may be just what you need to help you get
  started.

Overall, getting started at DART is a positive experience and you will
no doubt enjoy your time a part of the team.

\*Addition from Lizzy Kirkham: As a post doc I wasn't able to get my
staff card from the main library. Instead I had to submit a photograph
of myself via this website:
<https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/card/getting-first-card>.
Once the photo was accepted they then posted my card through the
internal mail. (I did receive instructions through the internal mail on
how to get a staff card but these arrived a few days after the staff
card did!)

Essential training for new staff
--------------------------------

New staff must complete 4 mandatory online training modules:

**Overcoming Unconscious Bias** **-** To increase understanding of
unconscious bias in the
workplace: <https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/courses/other-courses/elearning/overcoming-unconscious-bias>

**eDiversity in the Workplace** - To increase your knowledge and
understanding of equality and diversity
issues: <https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/courses/other-courses/elearning/ediversity>

**Info security essentials** --To learn the basics about the most common
kinds of attack to information:
<https://www.ed.ac.uk/infosec/learning-about-protection>

**Data protection** -- To learn about GDPR legislation and data
protection compliance in day-to-day work:
<https://www.ed.ac.uk/infosec/learning-about-protection>

Depending on your role, you may also have to complete a free, 1-day,
in-person course on **Good Clinical Practice**. This course usually
takes place once a month and needs to be booked in advance on the
Edinburgh CRF website:
<https://www.crts.org.uk/Content.aspx?dbid=crts&layout=CRTS+Master&theme=CRTS&areaid=118&name=Courses%20Advanced&type=Content&oid=Screen&uirefid=1274>

Make sure to keep a copy of your course completion certificate and email
it to your supervisor or study coordinator so it can be added to the
study file.

How to request annual leave
---------------------------

1. If you can, think about how your annual leave fits with the timeline
   for your project. Try to avoid annual leave at moments which we
   already know will be busy. That said, don't worry if you can't
   manage to co-ordinate your personal and work life!

2. Email your line manager (normally Sue) to request annual leave,
   noting the dates

3. Sue will reply to authorise the request

4. Forward Sue's reply to Ken O'Neill at v1konei3\@exseed.ed.ac.uk

NB: if you are a PhD student you don't have an official annual leave
allowance. However you should still take holidays and it is useful and
kind to let your supervisors know in advance!

Sue normally marks her annual leave on a calendar on her office door. If
you're planning further ahead than that, you can predict that she will
often be on leave during school holidays.

General Information about Annual Leave
--------------------------------------

The University has a Winter/Christmas closure over the Christmas and New
Year period during which only some services operate. Employees who are
not required to work during this closure period must use their Annual
Leave to cover this period, which is normally four days.

Further information is available on the university [HR
page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/policies-guidance/leave-absence)
and the [Leave and Absence Options
page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/policies-guidance/leave-absence/leave-options).

Reporting sick leave
--------------------

The Psychiatry procedure is for staff to contact their line manager,
preferably by phone, to inform them of any sick leave.  If by email,
then copy in Ken O'Neill so that he can record it on the HR system. 
Managers must ensure the University knows of any absence on the first
day of sickness as any delay can have an effect on staff's pay; if Ken
is on leave then please email Dorothy Air directly instead.

Staff need to provide the following information:

- The specific reason for absence.

- The length of time they expect to be absent and/or their expected
  return date if known.

- Whether they intend to seek, or have sought medical advice or help.

- Whether there is anything their manager needs to do to reassign
  their work or meetings for the time absent.

Line Manager and staff must also agree how to maintain contact if the
absence is expected to last longer than one day, so that we are kept
fully aware of the situation. 

After any period of absence of up to and including seven calendar days,
staff must complete the self-certificate section (Part 1) of a [**Return
to Work
form**](http://www.docs.csg.ed.ac.uk/HumanResources/forms/Return_to_Work.doc),
attached, ideally on the first day back, sending Ken the completed
form.  Managers should have a return to work discussion and complete
Part 2 of the form when the absence is longer than seven calendar days. 
The member of staff should then hand the completed form and any medical
certificates to Ken.

Further information is available via the University's [**Absence
Management
Policy**](http://www.docs.csg.ed.ac.uk/HumanResources/Policies/Absence_Management-Policy.pdf)

How to get a Research Passport (and what it is for)
---------------------------------------------------

*By Saoirse Heron*

For those of you who are carrying out research in collaboration with the
NHS, then it is necessary that you obtain a Research Passport. The
Research Passport ensures that your pre-employment checks are in line
with the NHS Employment Check Standards. Once your Research Passport is
approved it remains valid for 3 years and enables you to obtain an
Honorary Research contract or Letter of Access for the relevant NHS
board.

In order to apply for a Research Passport, the following is required:

- *A Criminal Record Check (PVG)* -- If you are not already registered
  with the Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) Scheme, then you will
  need to apply for this. However, if you already hold a valid PVG,
  then you will simply need to fill in a Disclosure Permission form
  along with a short section on the Standard Disclosure form and
  return them to the person assisting you with your application.

- *Occupational Health Check* -- This requires you to fill in and
  return the Occupational Health questionnaire to the person assisting
  you with your application.

- *Research Passport Form* -- Again, this requires you to fill in and
  return the form to the person assisting you with your application.

In relation to your Honorary Contract you may also need to supply:

- Two forms of ID (one of which must be address based)

- a copy of your CV (each page signed and dated)

- an IT declaration form.

This will all need to be returned to the person assisting you with the
application.

The application process itself is relatively straightforward. However,
it may take some time for your application to be processed and approved,
so be sure to start the process as early as possible.

How to get a mentor (and why)
-----------------------------

*By Sue FW*

Mentoring Connections is the staff mentoring programme.

The programme uses an online resource, [Platform
One](http://www.ed.ac.uk/platform-one), enabling Mentors and Mentees to
self-register, self-select and self-manage.  This brings an end to the
need for manual matching or opening and closing windows as the platform
is permanently available.  

You can register your profile as a Mentor or Mentee -- or both.  There
is a [help
guide](https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/creating_a_mentor_support_profile_on_platform_one.pdf)
for hints and tips on creating a really impactful profile.

If you've got any questions, direct them to this email address:
<Mentoring@ed.ac.uk>

YOURSELF WHEN CHOOSING A MENTOR?*
