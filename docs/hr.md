People & Money
--------------

*By Sue FW*

People and Money is the University's new (as of September 2020) system
for managing everything to do with people -- annual leave, contracts,
flexible working, annual review -- and money! This new system may
supersede much of the info provided below. For now, you can watch some
introductory videos for the system [at this
link](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/sites/ServiceExcellenceProgramme/SitePages/Core-Systems.aspx).

HR forms
--------

*By Sue FW*

Nearly all the forms and documents listed below should be [available at
this HR
website](https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/a-to-z-of-forms?utm_campaign=2315374_SEP%26HR%20-%20All%20staff%20email%20-%20Digital%20ways%20of%20working%20project%20-%2026%20Feb%2019&utm_medium=email&utm_source=dotmailer&dm_i=27JU,1DMJY,425AZ8,4J5IZ,1).
This includes:

- Ad-hoc payment form 100 for paying (some kinds of) external
  consultants for their time, see page 20

- Forms for External Examiners

- Flexible working requests

- A Job description template

- Annual leave calculator spreadsheet

- P&DR forms

The Voucher Reward Scheme
-------------------------

*By Sue FW*

This scheme enables line managers to issue small (£50 or £100) rewards
to staff who have gone above and beyond what is required in their role.
The reward comes as a gift voucher, so it isn't taxed, but it also isn't
cash. It is primarily meant for staff on lower grades who have completed
an "exceptional act or effort". You

There's details of the scheme including how to nominate someone [at this
page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/pay-reward/contribution/voucher-reward-scheme).
The process is very fast and you can normally issue a reward within a
week or two. The nominee will receive a letter and they need to collect
their voucher from the cash office.

Things to think about when recruiting an intern
-----------------------------------------------

*By Catherine Crompton*

Interns can be really helpful when you have, for example, a lot of data
collection or entry to do. However, it's important to make sure you find
a good match and to be clear about what is expected from an intern, or
it can end up being a lot of work!

Set up an initial meeting or skype to discuss & follow up with an email
giving clear definition of dates, times, funding availability (or lack
of) and what is expected of them. Sample email text below.

> We would be able to offer you a 1 day/week internship for 6 weeks at
> the DART lab, based at Kennedy Tower. However, we don't currently have
> any funding to pay you for this, so it would be an unpaid position. It
> is obviously completely up to you whether this is something you want
> to do: we do not want to exploit you and we understand if you're
> looking for a paid position. If an unpaid position is okay with you,
> we would do our best to make sure you got the most out of your time
> with us, and we'd be happy for you to start the position whenever
> you're ready. 
>
> An internship would involve doing three main kinds of things. Firstly,
> some boring stuff: making materials for research days, including
> making signs for the building, photocopying participant packs, data
> entry, possibly emailing participants and scheduling them to come in
> etc. Secondly, some research skills-building stuff, including scoring
> psychological tests, drafting recruitment emails, doing a lit review.
> Thirdly, you could do some stuff to help you understand what a
> researcher does and the research process: you'd be able to shadow me
> at my meetings, come to our fortnightly lab meeting with the DART
> group, etc.  
>
> We'd be able to give you a hot-desk on the 5th floor in a shared
> office, though you may need to provide your own laptop as we don't
> have a computer for that space at the moment. 

From an admin point of view, tell Ken ASAP. He tells me people need a
VRS entry (not sure what VRS is, sorry, but Ken sorts it out), a
completed confidentiality form, and two references. They'll also need a
health and safety building induction, with Ken, on their first day.

If they need help extending their visa this is particularly tricky and
not something I've managed with success, but for first port of call try
<visahelp@ed.ac.uk>

I suggest having a shared dropbox file which you use as a to-do list for
the intern, adding things through the week that they can check on their
intership day, rather than sending multiple emails. This has the added
advantage of them having a list of everything they've done at the end of
the project, which they can then use to update their CV, and that you
can use to write a reference.

**Make sure your Intern completes a Declaration of Confidentiality** to
show they have understood that they may be seeing confidential
information during their time with us. This is important even if they
aren't working with those data themselves -- they might see things over
someone's shoulder etc. There's a template Declaration in the shared
resources folder.

Recruiting and Hiring a new staff member
----------------------------------------

*By Sue FW*

Here's a basic step by step outline of how to hire someone at UoE. Your
contacts for this will be Sue Davidson or Dorothy Air (CCBS HR Officer).

1. Make sure you have done your [Equality &
   Diversity](https://www.ed.ac.uk/equality-diversity/help-advice/training-resources)
   and [Unconscious
   Bias](https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/courses/other-courses/elearning/overcoming-unconscious-bias)
   training.

2. Draft a job description using the [HR
   template](https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/job_description_template.docx)
   and agree it with anyone else involved in hiring. This is an
   important part of the process -- if your JD is too narrow you might
   not get a range of applicants to choose from. If it is too broad you
   will be swamped with ineligible applicants. Make sure it reflects
   the *things they will actually be doing* and the *skills and level
   of independence they need.* Think carefully about whether
   qualifications or experience are more important to you -- and what
   kinds.

3. Send your job description to HR for grading \[allow 4-6 weeks\]

4. Think about who you want to be on the interview panel, and agree an
   approximate date for the interviews -- the timeline below might
   help. Keep an eye on this as it can shift and you need to have your
   interview date agreed well in advance.

5. When the grading is completed, check it matches your vision for the
   post, and your budget! If not, you can adjust the JD and send for
   re-grading\*.

6. [Check the talent
   register](https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/recruitment/talent-register/recruiters)
   to see if there's someone already at UoE who could do the job you
   are advertising. If you spot someone, you can request their CV and
   if they meet the essential criteria for the job you
   [must]{.underline} interview them before advertising your post.

7. Assuming there's no-one on the Talent Register, you can then request
   for your job to be posted on the UoE Vacancies site. You will need
   to know: the Cost Centre and Job Code which is paying the salary;
   the full-time equivalent hours for the role; the duration of the
   contract; the salary grade; the planned start date**.** Your job
   advert should be based on the job description but also include an
   **estimated interview date.** There's a template job advert in the
   DART Resources folder.

8. When the job closes you will need to select candidates for
   interview, usually by making a long-list and then agreeing a
   shortlist with other panel members. Here is the [HR guidance on
   shortlisting](https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/recruitment/recruiters-guide/shortlisting/shortlisting-process).
   Make it as quantitative and transparent as possible.

9. Then ask the HR representative to invite them to interview,
   including information about anything you want them to prepare in
   advance. Here is the [HR guidance on
   interviewing](https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/recruitment/recruiters-guide/shortlisting/interviewing).
   Make sure the room is accessible.

10. After the interviews, HR will ask to collect in your notes and
    ratings, and they will inform the unsuccessful candidates. It's nice
    to offer feedback if anyone gets in touch.

11. For the successful person, you can offer the job directly by phone.
    Make sure you clarify that this is 'subject to references' if they
    haven't already been received. Once all references are in, you need
    to get their contract issued so keep an eye on this with HR.

12. The final stage is to think about induction -- what are they going
    to do in their first days / weeks in post? What resources and
    training do they need? Who do they need to meet?

\* *as a rule of thumb, undergrad degree = UE05, masters degree = UE06,
PhD = UE07, postdoc with a few years' experience / lecturer = UE08,
senior lecturer / reader = UE09, professor = UE10. Remember that
experience in a relevant role is often better than a degree though!*

In summary, here is a **timeline for recruitment**, assuming you don't
find anyone on the talent register -- if you do it'll take longer:

1. Draft and agree the job description with your team: +1 weeks

2. Job grading completed: +5 weeks

3. Talent register checked: +1 week

4. Job advert posted on UoE Vacancies site: +2 weeks

5. Application closes: + 2 weeks minimum, + 4 weeks normally. *You
    can't recruit outside the EU unless you advertise for 4 weeks or
    more.*

6. Long-listing candidates: + 1 weeks

7. Discuss shortlist for interview with your panel: +1 week

8. Send interview invitations: +1 week

9. Interviews: +2 weeks

In other words, recruiting someone will normally take about four months.
If you expedite every stage you might get this down to 3 months, but
rarely less than that.

Writing a reference

What is the talent register and why should you care?
----------------------------------------------------

*By Sue FW*

The Talent Register provides anonymised details of staff available for
redeployment to those who are recruiting for staff in the University.

Staff are eligible for redeployment as a result of being at risk of
redundancy, for health or medical reasons or when a position has been
red-circled. If you are in the final five months of a UoE contract you
can add your details to the register. Anyone recruiting to a new post is
required to check the Talent Register first to see if there's an
eligible person already listed. This is a great way to sustain
employment at the University.

What to expect from your Performance & Development Review (PandDR)
------------------------------------------------------------------

*By Lorna Ginnell*

So at some point Sue will let you know that she needs to panda
you...don't be alarmed! PandDR is short for Performance and Development
Review. All university staff have to check in once a year to make sure
they are meeting their objectives, that they are supported in doing so
by their supervisor and to set future goals. It's a lot less scary than
it sounds and a pretty casual affair. It's less about evaluating your
performance and more about identifying areas you can improve on and
opportunities for training/development and career progression. It's also
a great opportunity to raise any issues you have or make suggestions for
things that might help you to do your job better.

In terms of preparation you will need to fill in section 1 and 3 of the
form found here:

<https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/about/in-colleges/medicine-vet-medicine/p-and-d-r>

If it's your first one you can use the "Responsibilities" part of your
original job description for section 3. You should also have some idea
of what you would like to discuss around sections 5 and 6. For example
are there any courses you want to take? Is there a conference you would
really like to present at? Do you want to get something published? Do
you want to take time off? Are you happy with your working hours?

It can be a really nice experience because if you're doing a good job
you will get a ton of praise and if you're not then you'll get some
gentle encouragement and advice on how to do better. It can also have
the potential to be uncomfortable if you have issues to raise, don't
like taking about yourself or about the future. If that's the case
coming prepared and with an open mind might be helpful.

What to expect from your first year PhD review
----------------------------------------------

*By Shereen Sharaan*

**What is it to begin with?**

A 1^st^ year PhD review essentially evaluates whether a research plan is
in place and whether the current supervision and resources are adequate
to see this plan through. It also evaluates whether this plan is at
PhD-level and whether the student has the potential to carry it out.

**What is expected from you?**

- You are expected to do a significant amount of literature review in
  your first year, and closer to the time of the PhD review (at least
  1-2 weeks prior), you are expected to submit a written research
  proposal which zooms in on the research topic (specific questions)
  as well as how you approach the project (theory, methodology,
  potential outcomes, risks, resources, timeline, etc.).

- You may be expected to give an oral presentation to defend / discuss
  / expand on the written proposal as well your progress with the plan
  to date (this may include relevant trainings, conferences, writing,
  etc.). The number of words you are required to submit will vary from
  program to program (it is best to check with your school and
  supervision team).

- You are expected to upload all written documents on EUCLID (Annual
  Review Form) along with your completed sections of the form.

- You are expected to raise any concerns you have about your
  supervision team.

- You are expected to highlight any issues you are currently facing
  with your project and discuss how you might tackle them.

- Once your supervisors fill out their relevant sections on your
  annual review form, you are expected to review the form, and submit
  it for postgraduate director / school head sign off.

[\*Note on 'progress']{.underline}: Because each PhD is structured
differently, there is no standard measure for 'progress'. The important
thing is to establish clear milestones with your supervision team (and
their respective action points) for each year of the PhD program, and
share progress updates throughout the year.

**What is expected from your supervision team?**

- Your supervision team is expected to nominate an independent person
  on the review committee (can also be referred to as a 'critical
  friend').

- Your supervision team is expected to share feedback and ask
  questions about your written proposal (whether your topic is clearly
  defined, whether you are on track to meet your research goals, etc.)

- Your supervision team is expected to fill out their detailed
  comments on the annual review form.

- Your supervision team is expected to share some immediate indication
  of the review outcome (PhD-track, M-Phil/MRes track, or withdraw).

The [postgraduate
Wiki](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CPW&title=CCBS+Postgraduate+wiki)
is a great place to look for more info if you are a student within CCBS.
