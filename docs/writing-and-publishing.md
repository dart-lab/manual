# Open Access Publishing

_By Catherine_

Open Access is a way of making research outputs more widely read, cited and used. You can find more information about publishing open access at Edinburgh University [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/open-access). 

If you want to publish in an Open Access journal (also known as Open Access Gold), you have three options

1. Pay the fee from your grant funding, if it has been costed into your grant. 
2. Pay the fee from a University block grant, if your research has been funded by an eligible funder (currently UKRI, Wellcome, BHF & CRUK - see details [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/request-apc-payment))
3. Publish in a journal where the University has an Open Access Agreement (for details, see [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/request-apc-payment/publisher-discounts))

If you are unsure, you can contact openaccess@ed.ac.uk for advice. 

If publishing in an Open Access Journal isn't an option, you may want to deposit a copy in an Open Access Repository (also known as Open Access Green). You can read more about this [here.](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/open-access) 

# Sharing your paper with the University for PURE

To be eligible for the REF, new papers must be uploaded to PURE within 3 months of acceptance and 1 month of publication. The University will take care of this for you (and prefer to, rather than you doing it yourself!). 

When you have a paper accepted, forward the acceptance email to [ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk](mailto:ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk), and include the following information

* the date of acceptance
* the author accepted manuscript (i.e. your paper as a word doc or pdf, before typsetting by the journal
* the UoE reference number(s) of any grants acknowledged
* if you would like media support, please let them know and give them a brief summary of your findings. 

  Here is an [aide memoire](https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/ccbs_open_access_aide_memoire_v2.pdf) that you might want to pin up by your desk to help you remember.
