# Open Access Publishing

_By Catherine_

Open Access is a way of making research outputs more widely read, cited and used. It is also now University policy.

Before publishing a research paper, check the university's [Research Publications & Copyright policy](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/about/policies-and-regulations/research-publications). This page includes information on how the university can help you meet research funder Open Access publication policies.

The key points are:

* Members of staff own the copyright to their scholarly works.
* Upon acceptance of publication, each staff member with a responsibility for research agrees to grant the University of Edinburgh a non‐exclusive licence to make manuscripts of their scholarly articles publicly available under the terms of a [Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
* Manuscripts will be deposited in Pure (see below) and made accessible to the public on the date of first online publication (or conference end date).
* Publications should include the following text in the funding acknowledgement section of the manuscript and any cover letter/note accompanying the submission: _“For the purpose of open access, the author has applied a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission.”_

This policy applies to all scholarly articles, including conference proceedings, authored or co-authored while the person is a staff member of The University of Edinburgh. If, for some reason, you need to opt-out of this policy, [instructions on how to do that can be found here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/opting-out) - but both the university and DART lab encourage staff/students to follow theguidance.

The University provides [guidelines and a checklist](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/open-access-checklist-for-uoe-authors) for the steps involved in publishing Open Access whilst at the university.

# Open Access Journals

If you want to publish in an Open Access journal (also known as Open Access Gold), you have three options

1. Pay the fee from your grant funding, if it has been costed into your grant.
2. Pay the fee from a University block grant, if your research has been funded by an eligible funder (currently UKRI, Wellcome, BHF & CRUK - see details [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/request-apc-payment))
3. Publish in a journal where the University has an Open Access Agreement (for details, see [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/publisher-discounts); from Jan '22, this includes a new agreement with Elsevier)

If you need guidance on dealing with specific publishers, you can contact [openaccess@ed.ac.uk](mailto:openaccess@ed.ac.uk) or [anna.krzak@ed.ac.uk](mailto:anna.krzak@ed.ac.uk) for advice.

If publishing in an Open Access Journal isn't an option, you may want to deposit a copy in an Open Access Repository (also known as Open Access Green). You can read more about this [here.](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/open-access)

# Sharing your paper with the University for PURE

To be eligible for the REF, new papers must be uploaded to PURE within 3 months of acceptance and 1 month of publication. The University will take care of this for you (and prefer to, rather than you doing it yourself!), but if you insist on doing it yourself you still need to notify the University at the email address below.

Guidance and FAQs for this process can be found [here on the CCBS site](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/staff-only/ccbs-information-academics/recording-publications-in-pure-ccbs).

When you have a paper accepted, forward the acceptance email to [ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk](mailto:ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk), and include the following information:

* The exact date of acceptance
* The author accepted manuscript (i.e. your paper as a word doc or pdf, before typsetting by the journal
* The UoE reference number(s) of any grants acknowledged
* If you would like media support, please let them know and give them a brief summary of your findings.

Here is an [aide memoire](https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/ccbs_open_access_aide_memoire_v2.pdf) that you might want to pin up by your desk to help you remember.
