## How to Open Access Publish

_By Catherine_

Open Access is a way of making research outputs more widely read, cited and used. You can find more information about publishing open access at Edinburgh University [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/open-access).

If you want to publish in an Open Access journal (also known as Open Access Gold), you have three options

1. Pay the fee from your grant funding, if it has been costed into your grant.
2. Pay the fee from a University block grant, if your research has been funded by an eligible funder (currently UKRI, Wellcome, BHF & CRUK - see details [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/request-apc-payment))
3. Publish in a journal where the University has an Open Access Agreement (for details, see [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/request-apc-payment/publisher-discounts))

The UoE library has also announced a three year transitional agreement with Elsevier starting from 1st January 2022. Authors will now have the option to publish open access without paying a fee in participating Elsevier hybrid journals including the Lancet and Cell Press titles.

To be eligible, corresponding authors must be from the University of Edinburgh, have an acceptance date from 1 January 2022 and be publishing an original research article. More information on the agreement can be found here [https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/agreements/jisc](https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/agreements/jisc "https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/agreements/jisc")

For authors publishing in fully open access titles, Article Processing Charges (APC's) will still apply, however the library can continue to pay these APC's for authors funded by UKRI, Wellcome, CRUK and BHF

If publishing in an Open Access Journal isn't an option, you may want to deposit a copy in an Open Access Repository (also known as Open Access Green). You can read more about this [here.](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/open-access)

If you are unsure, you can contact openaccess@ed.ac.uk for advice. 

## UoE Open Access Research Publication Policy 

Some funders now require Open Access immediately upon publication under [**the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) licence. In the past most medical funders permitted an embargo of up to 6 months post publication, so immediate Open Access is a significant change. Amongst these funders are:

* [**Wellcome **](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/open-access-guidance/open-access-policy)– policy started on 1st Jan 2021
* [**UKRI**](https://www.ukri.org/publications/ukri-open-access-policy/) – policy started on 1st April 2022
* [**CRUK **](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/applying-for-funding/policies-that-affect-your-grant/policy-on-open-access)– policy started from 1st Jan 2022
* [**The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation**](https://openaccess.gatesfoundation.org/) – updated policy on 1st Jan 2021
* [**NIHR **](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/nihr-open-access-policy/28999)– policy started on 1st June 2022
* [**Chief Scientist Office**](https://www.cso.scot.nhs.uk/outputs/cso-open-access-policy/) – updated policy from 1st June 2022

**As of 1 April 2022, UoE has updated its Research Publications and Copyrights policy to make it easier for researchers to comply with these funder policies.  Researchers should now ensure that research articles are openly available at the point of publication. The best way of achieving this is for the author to grant a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence on the research output at the point of submission.**

### The key points: 

* The University of Edinburgh confirms the current practice that **members of staff own the copyright to their scholarly works.** 
* Upon acceptance of publication **each staff member with a responsibility for research** agrees to grant the University of Edinburgh a non‐exclusive licence to make manuscripts of their scholarly articles publicly available under the terms of a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence.
* Manuscripts will be deposited in Pure (details about Pure can be found in a section below) and made accessible to the public on the date of first online publication (or conference end date)

### What you need to do: 

1. The following Rights Retention Statement should be added in the acknowledgement section of your manuscript before submission for publication:  
   **“For the purpose of open access, the author has applied a CC-BY public copyright licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission**”
2. If you want to publish in a journal with open access fees, look into whether these fees are covered via a fund held by the Uni, or a deal with the publishers. Info on [funding available for open access publishing](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/request-apc-payment) can be found here and email [openaccess@ed.ac.uk](mailto:openaccess@ed.ac.uk) if you can’t find the information you’re looking for.
3. Make sure that you send a copy of your Author’s Accepted Manuscript (after peer-review but before any copyediting and typesetting) to [ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk](mailto:ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk) as soon as possible after acceptance, to be uploaded to Pure.

For further information, please see this [Open Access Checklist for UoE publishers](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/open-access-checklist-for-uoe-authors). 

## REF Open Access Policy

REF2021 Open Access Policy and guidance must be followed until further notice, i.e.:

* Deposit a copy of the Author’s Accepted Manuscript (after peer-review but before any copyediting and typesetting) in PURE within 3 months of the acceptance date AND
* Make it openly available as soon as possible after that

To comply, make sure that you send a copy of your Author’s Accepted Manuscript to [your local administrator](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/sites/CMVMOpenAccess/SitePages/CMVM-Open-Access-Contacts.aspx) as soon as possible after acceptance.

Remember that most medical funders’ policies require that a copy of the paper funded by them is deposited in [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/) and made openly available immediately on publication. If you comply via the gold Open Access route, the publisher will deposit your paper for you. However, if you comply via the green Open Access route, the responsibility for the Europe PMC deposit lies with the grantholder.

## Sharing your paper with the University for PURE

To be eligible for the REF, new papers must be uploaded to PURE within 3 months of acceptance and 1 month of publication. The University will take care of this for you (and prefer to, rather than you doing it yourself!).

When you have a paper accepted, forward the acceptance email to [ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk](mailto:ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk), and include the following information

* the date of acceptance
* the author accepted manuscript (i.e. your paper as a word doc or pdf, before typsetting by the journal
* the UoE reference number(s) of any grants acknowledged
* if you would like media support, please let them know and give them a brief summary of your findings.

  Here is an [aide memoire](https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/ccbs_open_access_aide_memoire_v2.pdf) that you might want to pin up by your desk to help you remember.

All corresponding authors from the University of Edinburgh can publish Open Access in these journals at no extra cost, whether your research is funded or unfunded. Please use your @ed.ac.uk email address and select the CC-BY licence if prompted

# Systematic Reviews

If you are looking for resources on how to write a systematic review for yourself or for a student, you can find plenty in this [DART lab Sharepoint folder](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/sites/DARTlab/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=4SKgNl&cid=e34c75dc%2Dc773%2D48ae%2Da627%2D9ed9534243c2&RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FDARTlab%2FShared%20Documents%2FAdmin%20and%20Resources%2F8%2E%20Undergrad%20supervision%2Fsystematic%20review%20templates%20for%20students&FolderCTID=0x01200062CA99FC3D8BF046B0C699BB419C06A0 "Systematic Review resources").

You can also watch or signpost [this lecture by Sue FW](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oecucbdo9ruc902/SFW_systematic_review_lecture_Sept2020.mp4?dl=0 "Systematic Review lecture") on the systematic review process. This lecture was delivered to a group of PhD students, so the level of information _might_ be too elaborate if you are looking to signpost the resource to undergrad or Masters students.
