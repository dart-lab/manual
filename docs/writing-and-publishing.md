# Open Access Publishing

_By Catherine_

Open Access is a way of making research outputs more widely read, cited and used. You can find more information about publishing open access at Edinburgh University [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/open-access).

If you want to publish in an Open Access journal (also known as Open Access Gold), you have three options

1. Pay the fee from your grant funding, if it has been costed into your grant.
2. Pay the fee from a University block grant, if your research has been funded by an eligible funder (currently UKRI, Wellcome, BHF & CRUK - see details [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/request-apc-payment))
3. Publish in a journal where the University has an Open Access Agreement (for details, see [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/request-apc-payment/publisher-discounts))

If you are unsure, you can contact openaccess@ed.ac.uk for advice.

If publishing in an Open Access Journal isn't an option, you may want to deposit a copy in an Open Access Repository (also known as Open Access Green). You can read more about this [here.](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/open-access)

### Funders requiring immediate Open Access

Some funders now require Open Access immediately upon publication under [**the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) licence. In the past most medical funders permitted an embargo of up to 6 months post publication, so immediate Open Access is a significant change. Amongst these funders are:

* [**Wellcome **](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/open-access-guidance/open-access-policy)– policy started on 1st Jan 2021
* [**UKRI**](https://www.ukri.org/publications/ukri-open-access-policy/) – policy started on 1st April 2022
* [**CRUK **](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/applying-for-funding/policies-that-affect-your-grant/policy-on-open-access)– policy started from 1st Jan 2022
* [**The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation**](https://openaccess.gatesfoundation.org/) – updated policy on 1st Jan 2021
* [**NIHR **](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/nihr-open-access-policy/28999)– policy started on 1st June 2022
* [**Chief Scientist Office**](https://www.cso.scot.nhs.uk/outputs/cso-open-access-policy/) – updated policy from 1st June 2022

This applies regardless of whether you are complying via the green (self-archiving) or the gold Open Access route (via publisher’s website). The following Rights Retention Statement should be added in the acknowledgement section of your manuscript before submission for publication:

**_“For the purpose of open access, the author has applied a CC-BY public copyright licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission”_**

This is to enable you to publish in traditional subscription-based journals and remain compliant with both the research funders’ and the University’s Research Publications & Copyright Policy.

**For University Open Access block funds Wellcome, UKRI, CRUK & BHF:** these are only available when publishing in fully Open Access journals and publishing platforms (hybrid journals are not eligible). Page and colour charges are no longer covered. Always remember to select the CC-BY licence when prompted.

### Read & Publish Deals

On behalf of the University, the Library continues signing up to [Read & Publish deals](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/publish-research/open-access/read-and-publish-journals) with publishers. There are now over 10,000 journal titles available to choose from. All corresponding authors from the University of Edinburgh can publish Open Access in these journals at no extra cost, whether your research is funded or unfunded. Please use your @ed.ac.uk email address and select the CC-BY licence if prompted.

### REF Open Access Policy

REF2021 Open Access Policy and guidance must be followed until further notice, i.e.:

* Deposit a copy of the Author’s Accepted Manuscript (after peer-review but before any copyediting and typesetting) in Pure within 3 months of the acceptance date AND
* Make it openly available as soon as possible after that

To comply, make sure that you send a copy of your Author’s Accepted Manuscript to [your local administrator](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/sites/CMVMOpenAccess/SitePages/CMVM-Open-Access-Contacts.aspx) as soon as possible after acceptance.

Remember that most medical funders’ policies require that a copy of the paper funded by them is deposited in [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/) and made openly available immediately on publication. If you comply via the gold Open Access route, the publisher will deposit your paper for you. However, if you comply via the green Open Access route, the responsibility for the Europe PMC deposit lies with the grantholder.

To enable the widest possible dissemination of research outputs, the requirement for immediate Open Access under the CC-BY licence is echoed in [the University’s new Research Publications & Copyright Policy](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/about/policies-and-regulations/research-publications), which applies to both funded and unfunded research – please refer to [the email from Professor Stuart Forbes, Dean of Research](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/sites/CMVMOpenAccess/SitePages/What's-NEW-.aspx#university-s-new-research-publications-copyright-policy).

# Sharing your paper with the University for PURE

To be eligible for the REF, new papers must be uploaded to PURE within 3 months of acceptance and 1 month of publication. The University will take care of this for you (and prefer to, rather than you doing it yourself!).

When you have a paper accepted, forward the acceptance email to [ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk](mailto:ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk), and include the following information

* the date of acceptance
* the author accepted manuscript (i.e. your paper as a word doc or pdf, before typsetting by the journal
* the UoE reference number(s) of any grants acknowledged
* if you would like media support, please let them know and give them a brief summary of your findings.

  Here is an [aide memoire](https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/ccbs_open_access_aide_memoire_v2.pdf) that you might want to pin up by your desk to help you remember.
