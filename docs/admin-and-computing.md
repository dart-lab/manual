How to download SPSS / get a new license key
--------------------------------------------

*By Sue FW*

You can [download SPSS from this
page](https://uoe-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ssds_ed_ac_uk/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx).

The licenses are updated every September, at which point you will need a
new authorisation code. You can apply to be sent the codes [using this
online
form](https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/software/main-software-deals/spss/licensing-spss/spss-codes-request-form).

There's more information about SPSS licensing and access at UoE [on this
page](https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/software/main-software-deals/spss).

How to connect to the Virtual Private Network (VPN)
---------------------------------------------------

*By Sue FW*

The Virtual Private Network is a way for University staff and student to
log in to their desktop remotely -- for example, from their personal
laptop.

The system gives you access to all your University folders including
DataStore, without you needing to copy anything onto your laptop hard
drive. It is normally the only way that you should access data or
anything else secure from outside UoE premises.

NB: If you are accessing data from home remember to be aware of who else
is in the room -- you shouldn't allow anyone else to see identifiable
data over your shoulder, for example.

There's a [step by step guide at this
page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/vpn/vpn-service-introduction).
Before you access VPN remotely for the first time you will need to:

1.  [Register for the service
    here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/vpn/vpn-service-registration)

2.  Make sure your UoE desktop is set up to be 'woken' remotely

3.  Download and install [a VPN
    Client](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/vpn/vpn-service-using)

Therefore make sure you take the time to set-up and check VPN before the
first time you need to use it for real.

How to set up/update a personal web profile (staff and PG students)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

*By Sue D*

**No training / specialist IT skills required**

We encourage everyone to generate a profile -- it only takes a few
minutes and there is no training, specialist skills or permissions
required. If you're not likely to update it very often, please keep it
very generic and don't include information that goes quickly out of
date, e.g. lab members, current grants.

**Why create a profile?**

You can add it to your email sign-off and CV, and it will give richer
results if someone searches for you on the UoE website.

Also, if you have a presence in several different areas of UoE (for
example, joint affiliation with another Centre) all the different Edweb
sites can link to your single profile page, and they will therefore all
be updated whenever you make a change.

**Profile photos - consent**

It is now necessary to obtain consent to display profile photos of
individuals on websites, intranet sites or notice boards. Because you
are in charge of your own profile, please remove your profile photo if
you do not consent for it to be shown.

**If you leave UoE**

Please remember to unpublish your profile when you leave (in the
'moderation' menu) as this does not happen automatically.

Creating / updating your profile
--------------------------------

- **Academics**

1. **Edweb**

PIs should already have an Edweb profile.

If you don't have one, or if you haven't updated it for a while, you can
log into it by clicking on the tiny "CMS login" button that appears at
the bottom right of every UoE webpage. There are further instructions at
<http://edin.ac/edweb-profile>

Please include Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences in the 'tag profiles
for overview tables' field so that you will appear on the automatically
generated table at
<https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/people/ccbs-staff-listing>

There are sometimes issues with the publication feed from PURE; if yours
doesn't display correctly please contact <website.support@ed.ac.uk>.

2. **PURE**

You can also create a profile on PURE -- instructions are at:
<https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/pure_-_edit_profile.pdf>. This
will feed through to Research Explorer.

Unfortunately the Edweb and PURE profiles don't talk to each other so
you have to create them separately. Note that for PIs, who have a
profile on the [Edinburgh Neuroscience website researcher's
page](https://www.edinburghneuroscience.ed.ac.uk/our-researchers), the
information is pulled through from your PURE profile.

- **Non-academic staff**

You can create an Edweb profile. You can just add basic contact details,
or you can add more information about your background and role.

If you don't have a profile, or if you haven't updated it for a while,
you can log into it by clicking on the tiny "CMS login" button that
appears at the bottom right of every UoE webpage. There are further
instructions at <http://edin.ac/edweb-profile>.

Please include Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences in the 'tag profiles
for overview tables' field so that you will appear on the automatically
generated table at
<https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/people/ccbs-staff-listing>

- **Students**

You can create an Edweb profile. You can just add basic contact details,
include your thesis title, and/or add more information about your
background and role.

If you don't have a profile, or if you haven't updated it for a while,
you can log into it by clicking on the tiny "CMS login" button that
appears at the bottom right of every UoE webpage. There are further
instructions at <http://edin.ac/edweb-profile>.

Please include Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences in the 'tag profiles
for overview tables' field so that you will appear on the automatically
generated table at
<https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/people/ccbs-postgraduate-students>

'Year of study' doesn't update automatically, so you will need to change
that each year.

If you have finished your PhD and are now staff, please unpublish your
student profile and create a staff one instead (follow instructions
above for academic or non-academic staff).

How to use the cloud printer
----------------------------

To use the cloud printer system you send your print to one of the two
cloud print queues, Cloud-Mono and Cloud-Colour.  There is also a
service
called [**EveryonePrint**](mailto:https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/printing/everyoneprint) that
allows you to print via a web browser. 

You can only retrieve your cloud prints at a cloud printer by
authenticating to your University account, which is done through the use
of your University (blue) staff or student card.  Using the card system
is as simple as touching your University card to the card reader, the
printer will then login with your account.  Note that the first time you
try to use your card with a cloud printer you may have to login with
your Office 365 password to link your account to your card, but this is
a one-off process. 

If you do not currently have a University card please see below for the
Lab Manual section on getting your staff / student card.

Most accounts will get a free quota for the cloud printing service
automatically; the quota is required to track prints and copies. 
However, if you login to a cloud printer and your account has not
received a free quota, leaving you unable to print, then contact **[the
IS Helpline](mailto:IS.Helpline@ed.ac.uk) **and ask them to add the free
cloud printing quota for your account. 

Anyone using a non-managed Windows computer will have to manually
add the two Cloud print queues by following [**the Non-Supported Windows
Desktop instructions**](http://edin.ac/1MUtCIV).

Anyone using a Mac computer will have to manually add the two Cloud
print queues by following Step 2 in [**the Printing from Desktop or
Laptop Macs
instructions**](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/printing/printers/mac-osx-10-10-or-newer).

If you have any queries please contact [**the IS
Helpline**](mailto:IS.Helpline@ed.ac.uk). 

How to book rooms, and which rooms are the best
-----------------------------------------------

*By Sue FW*

To book a room in Kennedy Tower you need to email Jim (<j.macgregor@ed.ac.uk>),
telling him which room you require and when.  He'll let you know if it's free
and provide advice on alternatives.

To book a room elsewhere in the University you can either:

1. Email <timetabling@ed.ac.uk>

2. Book through [this
   website](https://www.ted.is.ed.ac.uk/UOE1819_WRB/default.aspx)

Bear in mind that some rooms are available only to staff, and some only for
students. In most cases you will *request* a room, and should wait for
confirmation before being sure you have secured it.

You can also book rooms at various MVM sites including in QMRI and Chancellor's
Building through this site: <https://www.bookings.mvm.ed.ac.uk/index.asp> You
will need to register as a user first. In the case of QMRI, you can check
availability on the MVM bookings site but then need to request that the
reception staff book the room for you. When you check for rooms on the MVM site,
it will direct you to the right email address for that request.

The Dugald Stewart Building has some of the nicest meeting rooms in the central
area. You can often book direct by emailing
<https://ppls.schoolsecretary@ed.ac.uk> (but this is an unofficial route so be
circumspect -- i.e. not "Sue says I can book through you...")

Remember to **share accessibility information** about the room with visitors,
regardless of whether they ask. All University buildings are listed on the
AccessAble website and this includes local transport links and parking details.
[This is the page for Kennedy
Tower](https://www.accessable.co.uk/venues/kennedy-tower). One key detail for KT
is that the 8^th^ floor is accessed by stairs only so if you book this meeting
room you need to be confident everyone attending will be able to access it.

Click "create Guest Wifi Account" and enter your EASE log in. You can
create log in codes that last up to ten days.

What is Worktribe and do I need to use it?
------------------------------------------

*By Sue FW*

Worktribe is the University's research management and administration
system. It is used to administer every stage of a research project --
particularly:

-   Grant applications: pulling together the application, approvals from
    people like your Head of Department, and costs for the grant budget

-   Grant set-up: when funding is awarded Worktribe is used to set up an
    account for the grant, for example.

-   Grant reporting: worktribe makes it (relatively) easy to meet grant
    reporting requirements by holding all the relevant info about
    staffing, expenditure and so on

Because access to this system enables visibility of personal and
confidential information, including HR data (salaries) and research
activity (proposals, contracts), people need to [apply to be allowed to
use worktribe,
here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/finance/about/sections/fis/worktribe-access-request-form).

You only need to apply to use Worktribe, as an academic or student, if
you are going to be the Principal Investigator or a co-applicant on some
grant applications. Normally students won't need to join.

You can read more about Worktribe and access an online training module
[at this
page](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=WRM&title=Worktribe+Research+Management).

IT support: where to get it
---------------------------

Media Hopper: posting videos online and captioning them
-------------------------------------------------------

*By Sue FW*

[Media
Hopper](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/media-hopper-create)
is the University's video hosting site -- a bit like YouTube or Vimeo.
You can create an account and post videos, and then embed them on other
websites easily.

If you want a video to be subtitled there is [a 'pilot' service,
detailed
here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/media-hopper-create/help-and-support/subtitling-pilot).
Just email IS Helpline to request captioning for your video.

All staff and students can create and maintain their own profile page on
the UoE website (Edweb).

In addition, academics can have a profile page on PURE, which feeds
through to the public portal, Edinburgh Research Explorer.
