### Notes on language:

* Imagine reading your text out loud to an autistic colleague at the University - would you feel comfortable?
* There are big differences of opinion between disabled people and no form of language is universally preferred
* When speaking with an individual, or writing / talking about them (with their permission) you should always ask about their preferred language form and use this.
* Person first (e.g. person with autism) was historically preferred and came out of an early disability rights movement -- the goal is to put the person first, before the disability. Many parents of younger children and practitioners may expect this form of language.
* However, identity-first language (autistic person) is now very popular and increasing in popularity, especially among neurodivergent people themselves

### References

_by Holly Sutherland_

Some journals may challenge you on specific language, and it can be useful to cite research to dissuade them from, e.g. changing every instance of "autistic person" to "person with autism". Equally, sometimes it's useful to be able to challenge colleagues or organisations using outdated language by providing actual evidence of community preferences.
