### Notes on language:

- Imagine reading your text out loud to an autistic colleague at the
  University -- would you feel comfortable?

- There are big differences of opinion between disabled people and no
  form of language is universally preferred

- When speaking with an individual, or writing / talking about them
  (with their permission) you should always ask about their preferred
  language form and use this.

- Person first (e.g. person with autism) was historically preferred
  and came out of an early disability rights movement -- the goal is
  to put the person first, before the disability. Many parents of
  younger children and practitioners may expect this form of language.

- However, identity-first language (autistic person) is now very
  popular and increasing in popularity, especially among
  neurodivergent people themselves
