A list of funders for PhD research
----------------------------------

*By Bérengère Digard* and *Shereen Sharaan*

If you are a self-funded PhD student. I feel your struggle and I support
you. You can do it.

There are several funders out there that can help you fund parts of your
project, your PhD related travels, or even, dare I say it, your living
expenses.

Because one spreadsheet is worth a thousand words (and because I love
spreadsheets), here is a spreadsheet of some possible funders for you.

You should know that I only got one of these, so maybe this list is not
that great.

Writing a grant - how to get it costed
---------------------------------------

*By Sue FW*

Costings for a grant are estimates of how much it will cost to do the
project. Different types of grant costs are defined above on page 18.

When you are thinking about a new grant submission, the first person to
ask about costings for people in CCBS is <Luke.Richards@ed.ac.uk> and
his manager, if needed, is <Andrew.Liken@ed.ac.uk>

They can provide costings for your grant and also guidance on funder
requirements / budget constraints etc. Luke will reply with a reference
number in the subject line. You should use this in all future
correspondence about the project. He will also copy in a team mailbox,
<rso.funding@ed.ac.uk> Please don't email this address without also
including the reference number in the subject line of your email. If
Luke is on leave, his out-of-office auto-response will direct you to a
back-up RFS. There's a bit more info in the CCBS website at this link:
[CCBS Grant Application
Process](https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/ccbs_grant_application_process_sep18.pdf).

Key advice on getting costs for grants include:

- advance warning about planned applications is important

- it's useful to request costs right at the start - even if you know
these are likely to change - so the Worktribe item can be set up.  It's
then relatively easy to adjust these costs later. 

- you can also request variants of costs for comparison -- e.g.
research assistants and different grades or % Full Time Equivalents.

- It's ok to formulate costs my way when I send them in, they will then
be adjusted for entry into worktribe.  If I want the output (for entry
into the grant application form) in a specific layout / set of
categories I can send a template for this and request help getting the
right numbers in the right places

- I shouldn't worry too much if the costs I end up submitting to the
grant awarding body are not absolutely precisely the same as worktribe,
provided I'm confident I have enough money to pay people / do the work,
and it is in the right categories
