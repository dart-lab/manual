## Ordering catering

_By Sue Fletcher-Watson_

_For most university sites* you can order Online Delivered Catering.
Normally you can order food as close as 24 hours before an event though
obviously it's safest to give a bit more notice._

_There is_ [_information about the service at this
page_](https://www.accom.ed.ac.uk/for-staff/delivered-catering/)_ and an
online [_order form at this
page_](https://www.catering.accom.ed.ac.uk/KxWebCatering/CurrentBookings.aspx).
When you check out from the system there is a box for "Account Notes".
This is a good place to list the cost centre and job code which you want
billed for the catering \[see Expenses chapter for details on these
terms\]. In Psychiatry the "person to be billed" and the "authorised by"
will normally both be Ken O'Neill._

_If those links don't work for you, the best way to access the online
catering form is to _[_log in to MyEd_](https://www.myed.ed.ac.uk/) and
select Catering from the menu on the left hand side, or from the
Services tab at the top of the page.

_If you have queries about online delivered catering you can email_
[_accomoldcollege@ed.ac.uk_](mailto:accomoldcollege@ed.ac.uk) _or call 0131 667 1971_

_* However, **\[Online Delivered Catering will NOT deliver to Kennedy
Tower\]{.underline}!** For us you need to call to make your order. They
will ask for an approved signatory -- Ken or Sue can both do this. They
will send a form to print, sign, scan and return. You will need to
return the signed form **ten days** before your event date._

If you don't have ten days or object to the fact that our building
doesn't get a catering service like other University sites, you can get
catering locally. Normally this will mean purchasing yourself and
claiming back the cost. In the past we have ordered food from the [M&S
online food-to-order
service](https://www.marksandspencer.com/c/food-to-order/about-our-food-to-order-service),
which can be collected for free from the shop on Morningside Road. In
the 5^th^ floor kitchen and other locations around the Tower (try the
3^rd^ floor kitchen too) there are insulated jugs so you can provide a
way to make teas and coffees for large groups.

If you want to contribute to an on-going effort to get Kennedy Tower
added to the list of locations for Online Delivered Catering, please
email [_accomoldcollege@ed.ac.uk_](mailto:accomoldcollege@ed.ac.uk) _to request this._

## A register of assessments available to the DART group

_By Maggi Laurie_

Please refer to the spreadsheet 'DART measures and resources' for
content and information (Dropbox > DART Group > Lab manual content).
This is currently in a 'work-in-progress' state which needs updating by
lab members who are using/have purchased measures within their projects.

There are four tabs: Measures, Assessments, Toys and Games and iPads. In
Measures, you will find mostly paper questionnaires and assessments
which are self/parent-report -- i.e. they do not _directly_
measure/observe a phenomenon -- these items live in the Assessments tab.
You will see information about the item, when it was published, where we
have a manual available (Y = yes, N = no), where that manual/toolkit is
available from/stored at DART. You will also see what project the item
was purchased for, when it was purchased, and the rough age group that
the instrument is intended for (grouped as infant, child, adult). The
tab 'On loan/in use' will specify if the instrument is currently being
used for a project -- which means that someone might be able to assist
with sourcing and purchasing, and there may be spare booklets somewhere
for you to have a look and see whether you do want to use that item.
Also check the notes tab to see if items may be available to loan from
other places (e.g. PPLS) if they are in regular use for a project. In
Toys and Games, there are three categories: digital toys (separate from
iPads), toys associated with assessments (e.g. toys from the ADOS kit
which can assess symbolic play), and participant tokens (including
fidgets and participant gifts).

Note that for most items, we may have the manual available, but
additional forms and booklets may need to be purchased for your project.
It is your responsibility to check the content is complete before
commencing your project -- you many need to order extra report forms or
check games / batteries etc. Please also schedule time at the end of
your data collection period to clean, and neatly store the kit. It is
also important to check the version number/publication date, and
cross-reference online to see if a newer version of a measure or
assessment exists, e.g. ADOS-G vs. ADOS-2.

## A register of technology available to the DART group

_By Maggi Laurie_

See register of assessments and measures, which contains register for
'iPads' and a section on digital toys under 'Toys and Games.'

## Online services: Infogram, Qualtrics etc.

_By Sue Fletcher-Watson_

We have accounts with the following services, for members of the DART group only. Log-in details are available in the DART Teams account (Admin & Resources > Notebook)

1. We have an account with [Infogram](https://infogram.com/login) which is an online service for producing stylish infographics, recruitment flyers and so on. Please keep this account tidy by creating your own folder and keeping your infographics in your named folder.
2. We have an account with [Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/) which is an online survey platform - our account is now unpaid so this is only good for quick, short surveys.
3. We have an account with [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/) which is an online survey platform, best for questionnaires. If you are using a survey to collect research data, talk to Sue FW about creating your own independent Qualtrics log-in.
4. We have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPORsrJRCt1okyUF6csA3Dg) account.
