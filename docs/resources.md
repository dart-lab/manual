## Toys & technology available to use

_by Maggi Laurie_

You can find a list of toys and technology available to DART members [on Teams here](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/DARTlab/Shared%20Documents/Admin%20and%20Resources/3.%20Running%20a%20project/DART%20measures%20and%20resources.xlsx?d=wec6e392d137147bbbd7b79a59d17692c&csf=1&web=1&e=QmqtSz).

In **Toys and Games**, there are three categories: digital toys (separate from iPads), toys associated with assessments (e.g. toys from the ADOS kit which can assess symbolic play), and participant tokens (including fidgets and participant gifts).

In **Technology** we have a census of the tech cupboard on the 5th floor. The categories are: video equiptment, computer equiptment, gaming equiptment, other equiptment, "things in containers" (largely misc tech paraphernalia such as headphones, hard drives, mouses etc.), and "non-tech / misc." (such as tote bags and flattened boxes).

## Video Camera Protocol (aka don't be a jerk)

_by Sinéad O'Carroll_

Here at the DART lab we have ample technology for all our various
technological endeavours. Here is a quick guide to borrowing the
cameras.

| EBC (Edinburgh Birth Cohort) Cameras | DART cameras |
| --- | --- |
| There are two EBC cameras. These are labelled camera A and camera B | There are two DART cameras |
| These cameras are currently located in the bookcase near Lorna’s desk | These cameras are currently located in the cabinet in Maggi and Natalie’s office. |
| Please do not take the EBC cameras for anything outside of the EBC | Before you take the camera make sure that you are also taking the appropriate charger, USB cord and any SD cards you need |
| Before you take the camera make sure that you are also taking the appropriate charger, USB cord and any SD cards you need | Please also sign out the camera + tripods on the box and sign back in when returned |
| Before returning the camera make sure that:<br><br>1. The camera is fully charged<br><br>2. The SD card inside the camera is wiped of any and all recordings<br><br>3. All appropriate cords (chargers and USB are returned along with the camera)<br><br>4. The camera is being returned to exactly where you found it | Before returning the camera make sure that:<br><br>1. The camera is fully charged<br><br>2.

## Data collection tools available to use

_by Maggi Laurie_

You can find a list of data collection tools available to DART members [on Teams here](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/DARTlab/Shared%20Documents/Admin%20and%20Resources/3.%20Running%20a%20project/DART%20measures%20and%20resources.xlsx?d=wec6e392d137147bbbd7b79a59d17692c&csf=1&web=1&e=QmqtSz).

There are four tabs: Measures, Assessments, Toys and Games and iPads.

In **Measures**, you will find mostly paper questionnaires and assessments which are self/parent-report. Tools that _directly_ measure/observe a phenomenon, such as an IQ test, live in the **Assessments** tab.

For both kinds, you will see information about the item, when it was published, where we have a manual available (Y = yes, N = no), where that manual/toolkit is available from/stored at DART. You will also see what project the item was purchased for, when it was purchased, and the rough age group that the instrument is intended for (grouped as infant, child, adult). The column 'On loan/in use' will specify if the instrument is currently being used for a project -- which means that someone might be able to assist with sourcing and purchasing, and there may be spare booklets somewhere for you to have a look and see whether you do want to use that item. Also check the notes column to see if items may be available to loan from other places (e.g. PPLS) if they are in regular use for a project.

In **Experiment Battery** there are details of experimental tasks that lack the standardisation of materials listed under Assessments. Examples might include a perspective-taking task or working memory task like the N-back assessment.

Note that for most items, we may have the manual available, but additional forms and booklets may need to be purchased for your project. It is your responsibility to check the content is complete before commencing your project -- you many need to order extra report forms or check games / batteries etc. Please also schedule time at the end of your data collection period to clean, and neatly store the kit. It is also important to check the version number/publication date, and cross-reference online to see if a newer version of a measure or assessment exists, e.g. ADOS-G vs. ADOS-2.

# Digital Resources

_by Sue Fletcher-Watson_

### DART Lab Resources

We have accounts with the following services, for members of the DART group only. Log-in details are available in the DART Teams account (Admin & Resources > Notebook)

1. We have an account with [Infogram](https://infogram.com/login) which is an online service for producing stylish infographics, recruitment flyers and so on. Please keep this account tidy by creating your own folder and keeping your infographics in your named folder.
2. We have an account with [Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/) which is an online survey platform - our account is now unpaid so this is only good for quick, short surveys.
3. We have an account with [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/) which is an online survey platform, best for questionnaires. If you are using a survey to collect research data, talk to Sue FW about creating your own independent Qualtrics log-in.
4. We have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPORsrJRCt1okyUF6csA3Dg) account.

## Video hosting/captioning

_By Sue FW_

[Media Hopper](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/media-hopper-create) is the University's video hosting site -- a bit like YouTube or Vimeo. You can create an account and post videos, and then embed them on other websites easily. It can also auto-generate captions for your videos, and has a built-in 'find and replace' function for editing the captions generated. 

**_Top tip when using MediaHopper:_** Save and close if you are stepping away for longer than a few minutes. _It will log you out after a while. It's possible to keep editing, and apparently saving your progress, even if you have been logged out!_
