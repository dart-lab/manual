Ideas about student supervision
-------------------------------

*By Sue FW*

Here is Sue's [first blog post about her preferred supervision
style](http://www.dart.ed.ac.uk/how-to-manage-your-supervisor-if-your-supervisor-is-me/).
And here is [another post](http://dart.ed.ac.uk/advice-for-my-students/)
which added some additional points on the same topic.

This is [a more general post of
advice](http://dart.ed.ac.uk/dos-and-donts-supervision/) for new PhD
supervisors, by Sue and Duncan Astle.
