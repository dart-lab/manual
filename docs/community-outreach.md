# Community & Outreach

## Working with a study advisory board

_By Rachael Davis_

A study advisory board provides an invaluable community perspective for
research projects. This is achieved by ensuring that the board
members are diverse in terms of their knowledge and expertise.

For example, my study focuses on bilingual children with and without
autism. The board includes an autistic member who is trilingual and
works in education, a parent of an autistic trilingual child, a speech
and language therapist and bilingualism academics and experts.

The board members provide input on refining research questions and
protocols and shaping the study design, participation and dissemination
of findings based on the priorities of the communities they represent.
The diversity of board members ensures that every stage of the project
is aligned with the needs of the community that you are working for and
with.

### Sample documents:

* The first document is an email template inviting individuals to join
  the advisory board.
* The second document is a terms of reference sample that we used with
  our advisory board. Terms of reference are a set of rules that define
  the purpose and structures of the board. It ensures all members
  understand how each meeting will work and the expectations for board
  members. This should be discussed and agreed upon in the first board
  meeting.
* The third is a sample of working practises -- this refers to general
  rules for how each meeting will work for the board members -- for
  example, the frequency of meetings and what is expected from each
  member. It is important to have your working practise discussion points
  for your first meeting.
* The final document is an example of a voting system that we used for
  making decisions within the group. It's an inclusive, quick and easy
  voting system that ensures that everyone is getting a say in the
  decision making process.

## Working with a community advisor

_By Reesha Zahir_

One way to strengthen your research is by working with a _community advisor —_ someone who belongs to the group of people that your research focuses on. Working with community advisors can:

* Help shape your study in a way that maximises the relevance of your findings to the people that your research focuses on.
* Help you interpret your results meaningfully, using the context of your community advisor’s lived experiences.
* Improve the translational value of your research.

The expertise of community members can be useful at different stages of your research — from deciding the most relevant measurements to use in your study, to disseminating your findings to the people most affected by your topic of research.

Furthermore, working with a community partner also provides you with the opportunity to help _them_ learn something about how scientific research is done and the challenges we have to overcome as researchers. There are many engaging ways to do this — for example, you could organise a lab visit and arrange for them to see what your day-to-day activities look like as a scientist.

### Sample documents:

We have prepared a [Community Partner Recruitment Pack](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EVeUTF01szrbgmtQ6PpsoWEbu2dy58Sn "Community Partner Recruitment Pack") to get you thinking about how you want to involve community members in your research and to help you prepare the documents you need to recruit community members for your research. This recruitment pack contains the following: 

1. Introduction to the recruitment pack. 
2. Self-assessment checklist - designed to help you think about how you want to involve community members in your research. 
3. Recruitment advert - a template you can use to create your own advert to recruit community advisors.
4. Application form - a template you can use to design the online form for potential community partners to express interest in joining your study.

## Open access: Getting your papers made available to everyone

_By Sue FW_

Our Centre has a dedicated office who will take newly-accepted papers
and make sure a copy is posted up online for anyone to access. Simply
email [ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk](mailto:ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk) with your acceptance email from the
journal.

* Make sure that the email contains the date of acceptance
* Attach the final version of the manuscript that you submitted --
  this should have author details (i.e. include the title page in the
  document) but should not have any journal formatting. It needs to be
  YOUR copy.
* Make sure the manuscript includes acknowledgements for any funding
  that supported the work
* Add a note if you think the research deserves media attention -- if
  so, summarise the finding and the implications

## Poster printing

_Catherine Crompton_

Teviot Print Shop (based in the entrance hallway of Teviot Student
Union) do very reasonable poster printing, with fairly quick turnaround.
If you want a cheap fabric poster so you don't have to wrestle a poster
tube on to the plane, they charge for £35 for an A0 fabric poster.
