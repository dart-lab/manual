## Getting your papers made available to everyone

_by Sue FW_

Our Centre has a dedicated office who will take newly-accepted papers and make sure a copy is posted up online for anyone to access. Simply email [ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk](mailto:ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk) with your acceptance email from the journal.

* Make sure that the email contains the date of acceptance
* Attach the final version of the manuscript that you submitted -- this should have author details (i.e. include the title page in the document) but should not have any journal formatting. It needs to be YOUR copy.
* Make sure the manuscript includes acknowledgements for any funding that supported the work
* Add a note if you think the research deserves media attention -- if so, summarise the finding and the implications

## Poster printing

_by Catherine Crompton_

Teviot Print Shop (based in the entrance hallway of Teviot Student Union) do very reasonable poster printing, with fairly quick turnaround. If you want a cheap fabric poster so you don't have to wrestle a poster tube on to the plane, they charge for £35 for an A0 fabric poster.

# Community & Outreach

## Working with a study advisory board

_by Rachael Davis_

A study advisory board provides an invaluable community perspective for research projects. This is achieved by ensuring that the board members are diverse in terms of their knowledge and expertise.

For example, my study focuses on bilingual children with and without autism. The board includes an autistic member who is trilingual and works in education, a parent of an autistic trilingual child, a speech and language therapist and bilingualism academics and experts.

The board members provide input on refining research questions and protocols and shaping the study design, participation and dissemination of findings based on the priorities of the communities they represent. The diversity of board members ensures that every stage of the project is aligned with the needs of the community that you are working for and with.

### Sample documents:

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/rrm0b9h8z2t3qi6/Steering](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rrm0b9h8z2t3qi6/Steering "https://www.dropbox.com/s/rrm0b9h8z2t3qi6/Steering")[ group sample documents.docx?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rrm0b9h8z2t3qi6/Steering%20group%20sample%20documents.docx?dl=0)

1. The first document is an email template inviting individuals to join the advisory board.
2. The second document is a terms of reference sample that we used with our advisory board. Terms of reference are a set of rules that define the purpose and structures of the board. It ensures all members understand how each meeting will work and the expectations for board members. This should be discussed and agreed upon in the first board meeting.
3. The third is a sample of working practises - this refers to general rules for how each meeting will work for the board members, for example, the frequency of meetings and what is expected from each member. It is important to have your working practise discussion points for your first meeting.
4. The final document is an example of a voting system that we used for making decisions within the group. It's an inclusive, quick and easy voting system that ensures that everyone is getting a say in the decision making process.

## Working with a community advisor

_by Reesha Zahir_

One way to strengthen your research is by working with a _community advisor -_ someone who belongs to the group of people that your research focuses on. Working with community advisors can:

* Help shape your study in a way that maximises the relevance of your findings to the people that your research focuses on.
* Help you interpret your results meaningfully, using the context of your community advisor’s lived experiences.
* Improve the translational value of your research.

The expertise of community members can be useful at different stages of your research - from deciding the most relevant measurements to use in your study, to disseminating your findings to the people most affected by your topic of research.

Furthermore, working with a community advisor also provides you with the opportunity to help _them_ learn something about how scientific research is done and the challenges we have to overcome as researchers. There are many engaging ways to do this — for example, you could organise a lab visit and arrange for them to see what your day-to-day activities look like as a scientist.

### Sample Documents

We have prepared a [Community Partner Recruitment Pack](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EVeUTF01szrbgmtQ6PpsoWEbu2dy58Sn "Community Partner Recruitment Pack") to get you thinking about how you want to involve community members in your research and help you prepare the documents you need to recruit community members for your research. This recruitment pack contains the following:

1. Introduction to the recruitment pack.
2. Self-assessment checklist - designed to help you think about how you want to involve community members in your research.
3. Recruitment advert - a template you can use to create your own advert to recruit community advisors.
4. Application form - a template you can use to design the online form for potential community partners to express interest in joining your study.

## Room booking for community partners

_by Holly Sutherland_

Community groups you’re actively involved with can now use selected University rooms, free of charge, during the evening. This is an approved process which means everyone is insured and safe. If you know of a group which could benefit from this, please put them in touch with **Anne Douglas on** [**a.douglas@ed.ac.uk**](a.douglas@ed.ac.uk)**, 0131 651 5000.**

**What’s on offer right now:**

* Rooms for local (Edinburgh, Lothians, Borders, Fife) community groups with which you are actively involved. You do not have to be present at the meeting for which the room is booked.
* Meetings do not need to relate to University business in any way
* Choice of 12 rooms at 40 and 50 George Square, Monday to Friday between 6 and 9pm (individual room details in [Guidance Notes](https://www.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/communityaccessrooms_guidancenotes_0.pdf "https://www.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/communityaccessrooms_guidancenotes_0.pdf"))
* Rooms offered free of charge
* Ongoing bookings (e.g. weekly) welcome from now until 21st April (possibility of extension)
* All rooms wheelchair accessible

**What we can’t offer right now:**

* Use of IT facilities in room
* Catering facilities
* Any sort of meeting/event management – this is strictly room booking. (We can do a wee initial room induction, staff capacity allowing.)
* Meetings with attendees aged under 18, with the exception of ‘babes in arms’
* Use of rooms for groups with whom you are not currently actively involved. There are currently no details of the pilot on [www.ed.ac.uk/local](http://www.ed.ac.uk/local "http://www.ed.ac.uk/local") for this reason

Groups can request a room by completing a [Booking Request Form](https://w2.irm.ed.ac.uk/communityrooms "https://w2.irm.ed.ac.uk/communityrooms") and must agree to the Pilot [Terms & Conditions](https://www.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/communityaccessrooms_tcs_0.pdf "https://www.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/communityaccessrooms_tcs_0.pdf"). If they would like an informal chat first – we realise forms are daunting for some – they can contact Anne Douglas on [a.douglas@ed.ac.uk](mailto:a.douglas@ed.ac.uk "mailto:a.douglas@ed.ac.uk"), 0131 651 5000.
